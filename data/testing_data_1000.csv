Nicea DeGering: I brought Brian Carlson in on this segment as he’s a man but does already have a full head of hair. The older guys get, the more they start thinking about hair loss. In fact, hair transplant surgery grew in popularity by 76% from the year 2006 to the year 2014 and Dr. Scott Thompson is back on the show from Utah Facial Plastics to discuss what to know before getting hair transplant surgery in Utah. Is that true? Do you see that in your office?

Dr. Thompson: Yeah, I do and I think the big reason for that old school hair transplant was plugs, it was very obvious and very unnatural looking. And there’s been some huge advances in how hair transplant surgery is done. It works and looks completely natural and just pretty amazing actually.

Brian: So what are you doing instead?

Dr. Thompson: So in the past, multiple grafts of hair were just put in almost as a plug and now, we get under a microscope and we split each hair follicle into a single unit and that’s transplanted just like a normal hair is. We put certain hairs at the front and certain hairs in the back and we just know what the natural hairline is and how the hairline recedes so we’re able to use all that information to provide a natural result.

Nicea: So you’re not taking a section of hair anymore and it’s from the back, right?

Dr. Thompson: We are, we still sometimes take a section from the back of the head and we’ll slice that up into individual follicles. Or the other method for someone that wears real short hair in the back is to take the hair follicles out individually with NeoGraft and then there’s no scar on the back of the head. So there’s two ways to do it and we use both of them depending on the",420,11," patient.

4,0,26332,0,"Venezuela crisis: Familiar geopolitical sides take shape The crisis in Venezuela may have reached a new boiling point, but the geopolitical fault lines look familiar

MOSCOW -- Russia, China, Iran, Syria and Cuba have come down on one side. The United States, Canada, and countries in Western Europe are on the other.

As the crisis in Venezuela reaches a new boiling point — with embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro facing a challenge from opposition leader Juan Guaido — the geopolitical fault lines look familiar.

President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued statements Wednesday proclaiming U.S. recognition of Guaido, saying the U.S. would take all diplomatic and economic measures necessary to support a transition to a new government. Canada said it was recognizing Guaido as the interim president, and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called him ""the right person"" to take Venezuela forward.

But Washington's adversaries are issuing warnings against U.S. intervention. Russian officials have called the move a ""coup"" orchestrated by the U.S.

The U.S. and Russia already are at odds over Syria's civil war, and the Venezuelan crisis has the potential to add further strain. Russian-U.S. ties have sunk to post-Cold War lows over Moscow's support of separatists in Ukraine and allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.

""We view the attempt to usurp power in Venezuela as something that contradicts and violates the foundations and principles of international law,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

In a phone call with Maduro, President Vladimir Putin expressed support, noting that ""destructive foreign interference tramples on basic norms of the international law,"" and called for a peaceful dialogue, according to the Kremlin.

Venezuela's status as a major oil producer — it has the world's largest underground oil reserves, but crude production continues to crash — means its political instability has deep implications globally.

And Russia has taken a special interest. Last month, Russia sent two Tu-160 nuclear-capable bombers to Venezuela for several days in what was seen as a precursor for a possible long-term military presence.

Pompeo criticized the move at the time as ""two corrupt governments squandering public funds and squelching liberty and freedom while their people suffer. Peskov dismissed the comment as ""undiplomatic"" and ""inappropriate,"" saying that half of the U.S. military budget ""would be enough to feed the whole of Africa.""

Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday the crisis now ""has reached a dangerous point"" and urged the international community to mediate between the government and the opposition.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev even injected some domestic U.S. politics into the equation, citing the partial government shutdown and the differences between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

""Let's imagine, just for an instant, how the American people would respond, for example, to the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives declaring herself the new president against the backdrop of the budget crisis and government shutdown,"" Medvedev said on Facebook. ""What would be the reaction from the current U.S. president, especially if this move was supported by the leadership of another country, for example, Russia?""

Russia frequently decries popular uprisings like the ""color revolutions"" that have taken place in Ukraine, Georgia and other countries in its former sphere of influence.

China's Foreign Ministry also sternly urged against interference by Washington in Venezuela. Beijing's allies, including Iran and Syria, followed suit.

China ""opposes external intervention in Venezuela,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. ""We hope that Venezuela and the United States can respect and treat each other on an equal footing, and deal with their relations based on",794,11," non-interference in each other's internal affairs."""

How to call an Oracle function with a Ref Cursor as Out-parameter from C#?

I'm using a product that provides a database API based on Oracle functions and I'm able to call functions via ODP.NET in general. However, I can't figure out, how to call a function that includes a Ref Cursor as Out-parameter. All the samples I found so far either call a procedure with Out-parameter or a function with the Ref Cursor as return value. I tried to define the parameters similiarly, but keep getting the error that the wrong number or type of parameters is supplied.
Here is the function header (obviously obfuscated):
FUNCTION GetXYZ(
   uniqueId       IN   somepackage.Number_Type,
   resultItems    OUT  somepackage.Ref_Type)
   RETURN somepackage.Error_Type;

These are the type definitions in ""somepackage"":
SUBTYPE Number_Type IS NUMBER(13);
TYPE Ref_Type IS REF CURSOR;
SUBTYPE Error_Type IS NUMBER;

And this is the code that I have tried:
string sql = ""otherpackage.GetXYZ"";
var getXYZCmd = OracleCommand oracleConnection.CreateCommand(sql);
getXYZCmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

getXYZCmd.Parameters.Add(""uniqueId"", OracleDbType.Int32).Value = uniqueExplosionId;
getXYZCmd.Parameters.Add(""resultItems"", OracleDbType.RefCursor).Direction = ParameterDirection.Output;
getXYZCmd.Parameters.Add(""return_value"", OracleDbType.Int32).Direction = ParameterDirection.ReturnValue;

The I tried the following different ways to call the function (of course only one at a time):
var result = getXYZCmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
var reader = getXYZCmd.ExecuteReader();
var scalarResult = getXYZCmd.ExecuteScalar();

But each of them fails with the error message:
Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleException: ORA-06550: line 1, column 15:
PLS-00306: wrong number or types of arguments in call to 'GETXYZ'
ORA-06550: line 1, column 15:

9,0,21763,0,"I purchased a Mossberg 590 a while back and it came equipped with ghost ring sights. My question is this- Is there any way to modify a factory Mossberg heat shield to fit a gun with ghost ring sights? Have any of you done it? Please let me know, any suggestions are welcome.

This is for the 590A1 with the heavy barrel. If you have the standard 590, it will be a lot easier and you probably won't have to do any fitting.
The handguard is the Mossberg stock handguard in park finish.
To start with I had to get two slightly smaller diameter and longer machine screws and nuts. Sorry, I don't remember exactly what size. I would have written it down if I had realized how many times I was going to have give out this info. Luckily they did have some already in tactical black. Make sure that that you don't get them too narrow, you want them to stay secure and not go TU on you. You also want them to be at least two and half to three inches long so you will have enough room to work with them and to make it easier to secure the nuts without having to try to apply a lot of leverage on the forward barrel ring.
To fit the guard on the barrel, you will need to rotate it slightly to the side (9 o'clock or 3 o'clock) and hold it parallel to the barrel. Slip the rear barrel ring over the barrel (you want to do this at a point where the rear barrel ring can slip over the narrower barrel diameter as it tapers towards the muzzle) and start sliding the guard to the rear toward it's final position. You might have to rotate the barrel back towards its normal orientation and position (top dead center) on the barrel as you slide it to the rear. The forward barrel band should be slipped over the barrel as it clears the front sight assembly. You may want to put some masking tape on the barrel to prevent scratches for this step as it might be a tight fit depending on your guard and barrel.
You will have to relieve some of the metal on the underside of the forward barrel band. This is the part with the two ""ears"" that come down and that the cross screws secure. This piece is spot-welded to the actual body of the shield, so be careful that you don't remove too much metal",490,11,. You will have to test fit the guard as you

12,0,28340,0,"Kabru

Kabru  is a mountain in the Himalayas on the border of eastern Nepal and  India. It is part of a ridge that extends south from Kangchenjunga and is the southernmost  peak in the world.

The main features of this ridge are as follows (north to south):

 Kangchenjunga south top, 8476 m, at 
 A 6600–6700 m saddle, located at 
 A 7349 m summit, known as Talung, at 
 A 6983 m saddle, at 
 A 7412 m summit, at. This point has sufficient prominence to be classified as the highest point of a separate mountain, according to the definition used in List of highest mountains. It is confusingly referred to by some authorities as ""Kabru IV"", but it is not clear that this is correct, or that any ""Kabru"" name is correctly applied to this summit.
 A substantial ""field of firn"" measuring about 2 km from north to south, and 1 km from east to west. This is almost entirely over 7200 m, and the watershed divide that runs through this field does not drop below this height.
 A 7338 m summit, at ca., at the eastern boundary of the field of firn. This point is known as Kabru North. Although it is lower than the 7412 m summit, it has been at times considered to be Kabru's highest point, with the higher summit considered to be an unnamed summit along the ridge to Kangchenjunga.
 An intervening c.7200 m saddle
 A 7318 m summit, at, known as Kabru South is the southernmost ""7000 m peak"" in the world.
To the south west of Kabru south, there is a 6400 m saddle and a 6682 m summit known as Rathong. To its south east is the 6600 m Kabru Dome.

Mountaineering

The 7338 m summit of Kabru is the site of a mountaineering altitude record, either in 1883 or in 1905. The English barrister William Graham, the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kauffmann reported to have reached a point 30-40 feet below this summit, which Graham described as ""little more than a pillar of ice"", at 2pm on October 8, 1883. The ascent was questioned by powerful members of the Alpine Club and the Indian Survey Department, though not by their Himalayan climbing colleagues, and has been dismissed for most of the time since. Recent analysis suggests that the mountaineers may have been correct in their assertions after all. If Graham, Boss and Kaufmann did climb to ~7325 m on Kabru it was a remarkable achievement for its time, breaking the existing altitude record by at least 360 m (assuming a pre-Columbian ascent of Aconcagua) and holding on to it for twenty-six years (when in 1909 an expedition led by Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi reached about 7500 m on Chogolisa).

If their account is dismissed, the same peak nevertheless became the site of an undisputed altitude record on 20 October 1907, when the Norwegians Carl W. Rubenson and Monrad Aas came within 50 m of climbing it. Notably, Rubenson and Aas believed that Kauffmann, Boss and Graham had reached the same point 34 years before.

The summit of this peak, Kabru North, was first reached by C.R.Cooke on 18 November 1935, without oxygen, after his Swiss companion Gustav Schoberth succumbed to altitude sickness at their highest camp. It remained the highest solo climb until 1953.

Talung (7349) was first climbed on May 18, 1964, by Franz Lindner and Tensing Nindra of a German expedition via the West Flank and South Col. Their original plan to climb the high point of Kabru (p.7412) from the 6983 m col had to be abandoned.

On May 10, 1994, 12 members of a large Indian Army expedition led by Major A. Abbey reached the summit of Kabru North (p. 7338). Four more climbers would reach this summit on May 13. From the saddle in between, a total of 27 soldiers made the first ascent of Kabru South (p. 7318) on May 12 and 13. This expedition also accomplished a first ascent of the highest summit of Kabru (p. 7412), which they called Kabru III and at that time was estimated to be 7395 m high. Three  members led by Na",969,11,ib Subedar Dan Singh reached the peak on May 12

Using two patterns - One for warn and above. One for everything below

How can I set up log4j to use two separate patterns based on the logging level of the message?
For example, right now I'm using the following which applies to all levels:
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - %m%n

What I'd like to do is use a different pattern for levels of WARN and above.  Such as:
%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - [%L:%C] %m%n

To output the line number and class where the warning or error occurred.  The extra cost of pulling the caller information would be worth it in situations where a warning or error occurs.
Is this doable?
Here is my full log4j.properties file:
log4j.rootLogger=WARN, stdout1, stdout2
log4j.category.my.package=DEBUG

log4j.appender.stdout1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout1.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout1.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - %m%n

log4j.appender.stdout2=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout2.threshold=WARN
log4j.appender.stdout2.target=System.err
log4j.appender.stdout2.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout2.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - [%t] [%L:%C] %m%n

EDIT
threshold looks to be what I need to log all levels of WARN and higher.  Is there a similar property that will configure the other appender to log all levels of INFO and lower?

Using two patterns - One for warn and above. One for everything below

How can I set up log4j to use two separate patterns based on the logging level of the message?
For example, right now I'm using the following which applies to all levels:
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - %m%n

What I'd like to do is use a different pattern for levels of WARN and above.  Such as:
%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - [%L:%C] %m%n

To output the line number and class where the warning or error occurred.  The extra cost of pulling the caller information would be worth it in situations where a warning or error occurs.
Is this doable?
Here is my full log4j.properties file:
log4j.rootLogger=WARN, stdout1, stdout2
log4j.category.my.package=DEBUG

log4j.appender.stdout1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout1.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout1.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - %m%n

log4j.appender.stdout2=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout2.threshold=WARN
log4j.appender.stdout2.target=System.err

log4j.appender.stdout2.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH\:mm\:ss} - [%t] [%L:%C] %m%n

EDIT
threshold looks to be what I need to log all levels of WARN and higher.  Is there a similar property that will configure the other appender to log all levels of INFO and lower?

A:

Found the answer here: Logging error to stderr and debug, info to stdout with log4j

Smithsonian scientists have confirmed that chytridiomycosis, a rapidly spreading amphibian disease, has reached a site near Panama's Darien region. This was the last area in the entire mountainous neotropics to be free of the disease. This is troubling news for the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project, a consortium of nine U.S. and Panamanian institutions that aims to rescue 20 species of frogs in imminent danger of extinction.

Chytridiomycosis has been linked to dramatic population declines or even extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Within five months of arriving at El Cope in western Panama, chytridiomychosis extirpated 50 percent of the frog species and 80 percent of individuals.

""We would like to save all of the species in the Darien, but there isn't time to do that now,"" said Brian Gratwicke, biologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and international coordinator for the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project. ""Our project is one of a few to take an active stance against the probable extinction of these species. We have already succeeded in breeding three species in captivity. Time may be running out, but we are looking for more resources to take advantage of the time that remains.""

The Darien National Park is a World Heritage site and represents one of Central America's largest remaining wilderness areas. In 2007, Doug Woodhams, a research associate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, tested 49 frogs at a site bordering the Darien. At that time, none tested positive for the disease. In January 2010, however, Woodhams found that 2 percent of the 93 frogs he tested were infected.

""Finding chytridiomycosis on frogs at a site bordering the Darien happened much sooner than anyone predicted,"" Woodhams said. ""The unrelenting and extremely fast-paced spread of this fungus is alarming.""

The Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project has already established captive assurance colonies in Panama of two priority species endemic to the Darienthe Pirre harlequin frog (Atelopus glyphus) and the Toad Mountain harlequin frog (A. certus). In addition, the Smithsonian's National Zoo maintains an active breeding program for the Panamanian golden frog, which is Panama's national animal. The Panamanian golden frog is critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and researchers have not seen them in the wild since 2008.

""We would like to be moving faster to build capacity,"" Gratwicke said. ""One of our major hurdles is fundraising to build a facility to house these frogs. Until we jump that hurdle, we're limited in our capacity to take in additional species.""

Nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species are at risk of extinction. While the global amphibian crisis is the result of habitat loss, climate change and pollution, chytridiomycosis is at least partly responsible for the disappearances of 94 of the 120 frog species thought to have gone extinct since 1980.

""These animals that we are breeding in captivity will buy us some time as we find a way to control this disease in the wild and mitigate the threat directly,"" said Woodhams, who was the lead author of a whitepaper Mitigating Amphibian Disease: strategies to maintain wild populations and control chytridiomycosis. This paper, published in Frontiers in Zoology, systematically reviews disease-control tools from other fields and examines how they might be deployed to fight chytrid in the wild. One particularly exciting lead in the effort to find a cure is that anti-chytrid bacteria living on frog skin may have probiotics properties that protect their amphibian host from chytrid by secreting anti-fungal chemicals. Woodhams recently discovered that some Panamanian species with anti-chytrid skin bacteria transmit beneficial skin chemicals and bacteria to their offspring. The paper, Social Immunity in Amphibians: Evidence for Vertical Transmission of Innate Defenses, was published in Biotropica in May.

19,0,20131,0,"This invention relates to bottle orienting apparatus, and more particularly relates to apparatus for accepting bottles, each of which has a first end and a second end, in random, first end leading and first end trailing dispositions, and selectively reorienting the bottles so that they lie in substantially uniform, first end leading dispositions.
Pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic manufacturers among others utilize literally millions of bottles each year. As can be appreciated, these bottles must be processed on high speed treating and filling equipment, and they must be fed into such equipment in substantially uniform dispositions. For example, if bottles entering a filling machine were fed into such a machine in random dispositions, the filling nozzles would be aligned with the openings of some of the bottles, but would be misaligned with the openings of other ones of the bottles.
Normally, after the bottles have been formed, they are simply placed into boxes or bins in completely random disposition. Various types of apparatus are available for accepting a mass of such randomly oriented bottles and discharging them one by one in substantially endwise dispositions so that they constitute a stream of advancing bottles. However, such apparatus discharges some of the bottles with one end leading and discharges others of the bottles in the stream with the other end leading. Therefore, before such a stream of advancing bottles reaches the bottle treating and filling equipment, certain ones of the bottles must be reoriented so that all of the bottles lie in a substantially uniform disposition. Various devices have been proposed to accomplish such selective reorientation.
In describing apparatus of this type, it is useful to describe the elements of the apparatus with reference to the direction of motion of the bottles being processed. Thus, the term ""downstream"" should be understood as meaning ""in the direction of motion of the bottles being processed"", and the term ""upstream"" should be understood as meaning the reverse direction.
As can be appreciated, the cost of processing each bottle through any such apparatus will be inversely proportional to the speed of operation of the apparatus. As the speed of operation of the apparatus is increased, the cost of operating the apparatus for a given period of time is spread among a larger number of bottles, so that the cost of processing each",452,11," bottle is reduced.

The comparison between both types of packets is done in Section 7 where we also describe the family of Arthur parameters considered in the work of Adams and Johnson and give a description of the Adams-Johnson packets.

We continue by outlining the contents of the paper. In Section 2 we describe the context in which we will do representation theory. We recall the notion of real form and introduce the concepts of extended group and representation of a strong real form. This is just a short review of Chapters 2 [@ABV].

Section 3 is devoted to the introduction of the geometric objects required in the definition of micro-packets, namely: the category of perverse sheaves, the category of $\mathcal{D}$-modules, and the notion of characteristic variety and characteristic cycle. We follow mainly Chapter 2 [@Hotta] and Chapter 7 and 19 [@ABV].

In Section 4 we introduce the geometric induction functor as a geometric counterpart of the induction functor in representation theory.

Producer Jeff Deutchman deployed documentary crews around the U.S. on Election Day and curated the results into a 16-strand composite portrait.

Aiming for a snapshot of the American electorate during the final countdown of a very, very long presidential race, producer Jeff Deutchman comes far closer than he did with his more off-the-cuff, Obama-celebratory 11/4/08. The documentary 11/8/16 compiles Election Day portraits of 16 subjects, captured by 18 filmmakers, into a mosaic that's not so much revelatory as humanizing.

The huge political and social divide is in full evidence, but the strength of the doc is that it shows that those sides aren't as monolithic as the red and blue blocks on electoral maps suggest. The willingness of the average American, whether on one of the coasts or in the country's vast middle, to hear opposing viewpoints remains seriously in doubt, but the film offers an opportunity to do just that, showcasing sincere, well-meaning Americans who occupy various points on the political spectrum. Some are better informed than others. A number of the subjects express a lot of the same ideas, half-baked and otherwise, as do cable pundits, but their ground-level view adds context and immediacy in a way that professional blatherers can't.

Competing in the Hamptons and slated for a November theatrical release, the film isn't headed for a box-office landslide. Given the almost daily dramas associated with the Trump administration, the last hours of the race might feel like ancient history to potential viewers, too painful for some and beside the point for others. Yet Deutchman and his team of directors — who include Alison Klayman (Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry), Martha Shane (After Tiller) and Bassam Tariq (These Birds Walk) — tap into the ballot-box suspense, anticipation and, in some cases, indifference, from intriguing angles.

24,0,27811,0,"Prince Albert (genital piercing)

The Prince Albert (PA) is one of the most common male genital piercings. The PA is ""a ring-style piercing that extends along the underside of the glans from the urethral opening to where the glans meets the shaft of the penis."" The related ""reverse Prince Albert piercing"" enters through the urethra and exits through a hole pierced in the top of the glans.

While some piercers may choose to avoid the nerve bundle that runs along the center of the frenulum altogether, others may choose otherwise. The piercing can be centred if the bearer is circumcised. Otherwise, the piercing must be done off-centre so that the surrounding skin can reposition itself.

Healing and potential side effects
The Prince Albert healing time can take from 4 weeks to 6 months. A fresh PA piercing may cause bleeding, swelling and inflammation. In rare cases, it can lead to local infections. Some men find that the dribble caused by the PA when urinating necessitates sitting down to urinate. With practice, some men can control the stream while standing.

Some PA wearers report it enhances sexual pleasure for both partners. However, others penetrated by males with this piercing report discomfort. PA rings can cause additional discomfort to female partners in cases when the penis comes in contact with the cervix. Sexual partners of those with piercings may experience complications during oral sex such as chipped teeth, choking, foreign bodies getting stuck between the partner's teeth, and mucosal injury to receptive partners.

As with many piercings, there is risk of the jewelry becoming caught on clothing and being pulled or torn out. Very large gauge or heavy jewelry can cause thinning of the tissue between the urethral opening and the healed fistula resulting in an accidental tearing or other complications with sexual experiences. Conversely, extremely thin jewelry can cause the same tearing in what is commonly referred to as the ""cheese cutter effect"", either during sudden torsion or over a long period of wearing, especially if the thin jewelry bears any weight.

Jewelry 

Prince Albert piercings are typically pierced at either 12 or 10g (2 or 2.5mm). They are often (gradually) stretched soon after, with jewelry within the 8g to 2g (3mm to 6.5mm) range being the most popular. One of the reasons not to perform the initial piercing at a small diameter (16g or 14g) or otherwise to immediately stretch it to 10g or 8g using a taper is to prevent the 'cheese-cutter effect', although personal preference and individual anatomy also play a role in these decisions.

Further stretching to sizes 0 or 00g (8 or 9mm) and larger is not uncommon. If a sufficiently heavy barbell or ring is worn continuously, a mild form of 'auto-stretching' can be observed. This means that stretching to",613,11, a larger gauge is easier and might not require a t

Interactions from individual $i$ to individual $j$ may arise as a response to past interactions from $j$ to $i$ through the kernel $g_\phi$, or via the base intensity $\mu_{ij}$.

The number of communities $p$ is assumed known. We model the base rate $$\mu_{ij}=\mu_{ji}=\sum_{k=1}^p w_{ik}w_{jk}.\label{eq:muij}$$Two nodes with high levels of affiliation to the same communities will be more likely to interact than nodes with affiliation to different communities, favouring assortativity.

Puerto Rico's government says it has sent humanitarian aid to Venezuela for the first time via a plane loaded with 3,600 pounds (1,633 kilograms) worth of supplies that included medication, food and items for children.

A spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's Secretary of State said Thursday that the humanitarian aid is not part of the $20 million in aid pledged by the United States. Ana Santos Pico told The Associated Press that she could not provide additional information such as what kind of plane was used for Wednesday's mission and who owns it.

Santos said: ""It's a complicated mission, and we cannot provide more details. We need to maintain strict confidentiality.""

Venezuelan community leader Sonia Cosme told the AP that the medication sent to Venezuela is to help treat diabetes, blood pressure, asthma and seizures. The items for children include diapers, formula, milk, oral serums and protein drinks. The food items were mostly cereals.

No further details were available, including where the plane landed.

Cosme said: ""Humanitarian aid has to be done with a very low profile. They persecute those who send it and those who receive it.""

I know mentioning the Seahawks in any sort of a positive way is usually cause for uproar amongst San Francisco 49ers fans, but we have a more pressing matter. The folks over at Milehighreport.com, and more specifically @Bronco_Mike251, seem to think that the Broncos would have won the Super Bowl had they played the 49ers instead of the Seahawks. Don't worry, I'll wait while you finish chuckling, scratching your head, and wondering if they are delusional, partaking in the newly legalized party favors in Denver, or some odd combination of the two.

Now, the Broncos had a great regular season and Peyton Manning had one of the best seasons as a quarterback in the history of the NFL. The Broncos were the number one seed in the AFC and held their own until that fateful Sunday evening at The Meadowlands. But to say the 49ers would have lost to the Broncos...let's be realistic.

Practical use of State or Strategy pattern

I have this in my code
switch (auctionType)
                {

                        destination = new EnglishAuction();

                        break;
                }

What I am wondering is how do I eliminate the switch statement by using the Strategy or State pattern?

A:

The code you posted is indeed a factory. In a factory, switches are OK.
The Auction objects you return probably belong to a strategy. The difference between strategy and state is subtle, but important:

In a strategy, you're using different algorithms to accomplish essentially the same thing. The caller must not need to know this, it's an implementation detail. Some examples of strategies might be

In a computer game, you want your AI bad guys to attack the player. Different enemies might use different strategies because they might be able to fly over obstacles, teleport to the player or have different combat style.
In a HybridDictionary, operations might be implemented in a simple ListDictionary while the collection is small and use a Hashtable once the collection grows.
In a CAD application, you might have implemented different strategies to calculate the solution for a complex equation depending on a variety of factors to find the optimal level of speed vs. accuracy.

This sometimes leads to confusion, because the different monster's behavior is 'obvious' or at least visible to the end-user, while the latter aren't. On the other hand, it is visible because it's hopefully faster / more precise. It's just not that obvious, usually.
in a State pattern, on the other hand, the class will behave differently. The classical state pattern example is a TcpSocket class: The socket could be, among others, in connected or disconnected state. This is visible to the client, and calling Disconnect() on a disconnected socket is an error, as is calling Connect() on a socket that is already connected. The object itself can change its state, and it's visible and known to the outside.

Since you are using a factory, the Auction object returned will probably not change type during its lifetime as part of the normal operation. Implementations of state typically don't go through a factory because they are not interchangeable. Instead, you would create a TcpSocket which uses TcpSocketClosed internally and changes to TcpSocketConnected after you successfully called Connect().

Patient asthma education is increasingly being viewed as an important aspect of the ambulatory care setting \[[@B17]\]. Paul et al. \[[@B1]\] demonstrated that asthma education during patient visits is associated with a reduced number of antibiotic prescriptions. The results from this finding suggest other potential benefits for asthma education, as it seems to be associated with more judicious prescribing of antibiotics by providers. Parent-doctor communication during visits is associated with the prescription of antibiotics with the asthma medication. Some parents who believe their children have a disease which should or could be treated with antibiotics may directly request antibiotics \[[@B18]\]. If the patients and their parents are informed and educated about asthma during the visit to the specialist, they are less likely to request antibiotics. This, of course, leads to a general decrease in antibiotic usage \[[@B1]\]. Our patients and their parents were informed and educated at every visit.

The limitation of this study was that for the year prior to the diagnosis of asthma, the patients were evaluated retrospectively. The number of episodes and the frequency of antibiotic usage were obtained from the database and parent reports. The use of a standard classification system for antibiotics may be more reliable. However, in the year after the diagnosis of asthma, patients were regularly followed up prospectively by the specialists and no patients were excluded from the study.

Conclusion {#sec1_5}
==========

This study showed that the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma significantly reduce the frequency of antibiotic usage and the number of asthma episodes. Diagnostic certainty about asthma exacerbations, appropriate therapies and regular follow-up contributed to these results as well as follow-up visits to a specialist.

After reaching the safety of the house, he wedged the front door back into place, grateful to finally escape the storm that continued to rage into the night.

“Oh, thank god,” said Maria, hugging herself tightly for warmth. Chilly rainwater dripped from the hem of her dress, forming an inky black puddle in a ring around her feet.

Standing beside her in the entryway, Paul wiped the thin rivulets of water from his face with the back of his arm before using his flashlight to scan around the dusky house.

“Whoa—” he exclaimed under his breath as the weak beam glassed over the previous occupant’s belongings. They appeared to be untouched, dutifully waiting as if their owner might yet return at any moment.

“Are you sure people aren’t living here anymore?” asked Maria, her eyes following the light around the room.

The inside of the house, like many erected in those parts of the map regularly beset by the hot, steamy air of the sub-tropics, was open and spacious. From where they stood they could see a majority of the downstairs, save for a few rooms still yet hidden away behind closed doors. Directly in front of them was the deserted remains of a sitting parlor—a matching set of moldy sofas and upholstered chairs casually positioned around ornately carved wooden end-tables.

Just past the dusty furniture, a stairwell led up to the second floor hallway where the balcony offered a commanding birds-eye view down into the parlor. Despite the less-than-ideal location and its current condition, it was obvious that the house had once belonged to a distinguished family.

Maria had to admit that it looked as though they might be the first ones to step foot inside the house for quite some time. A thick, fuzzy layer of gray dust coated every surface while abandoned cobwebs rippled in the drafty air currents wherever their builders had once deigned fit to construct them. On the walls, colossal oil paintings displayed picturesque rural sceneries: a turquoise stream meandering through the foothills; a squat, chunky windmill stoically braving the relentless prairie gusts; a supplicated weeping willow bowing obediently at the edge of a glassy pond.

“It’s weird,” she said, “I wonder why they left everything behind. I’m starting to get a little creeped out.”

“What? There’s nothing creepy about it. The last owner probably died without leaving it to anyone. Or maybe the family is fighting over everything in probate. Either way, it doesn’t matter—we’re not here to rob them.” Paul searched the walls with his flashlight and said, “I don’t expect there’s a working phone, but at least we can ride out the storm until morning and then figure out a way to get out of here.” He reached over to the light switch on the wall and flicked it up, correctly assuming it to be a pointless gesture.

Shining the flashlight onto the sofas in the sitting parlor, he said, “Here, sit right there and I’ll see if I can find us some towels or blankets or something. It’ll be better once we’re dry.”

“You’re not leaving me here alone,” said Maria quickly.

Paul didn’t reply, searching around the room with the light instead. “Ah—” he said, walking over to a long credenza set against the left wall. Resting atop the dusty cabinet",829,11,", a glass oil lamp glittered under the beam of"

At the fiesta organized around the first public tasting of Csopak's 2013 wines, we asked the minds behind the Csopak Codex, István Jásdi and Tamás Kovács about this year's harvest and the characteristics of a good Welschriesling from Csopak.

After this year's rainy summer, next year's autumn will definitely arrive with less good wine - this is already considered a certainty among the majority of Csopak's winemakers. But let us not rush forward, because there is still reason to celebrate this year! The weather in 2013 was favourable for the Welschriesling as well as for a lot of other varieties. The independent jury rewarded 13 wines of the 2013 vintage with the highest, Vinea Csopak Nobilis Districtus (VDNC Csopak) qualification.

Majeske II, 218 F.3d at 820.
Defendant reads too much into this passage. Sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict is always a legal question for which the reviewing court, as with all legal issues, has de novo or plenary review. See Lenker v. Methodist Hospital, 210 F.3d 792, 796 (7th Cir.2000); Pierce v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry., 65 F.3d 562, 567-68 (7th Cir.1995); Agretti v.

Hill, 196 F.3d 806, 808 (7th Cir.1999) (""basically there is deferential review and non-deferential (plenary) review""). The Contractors Association case cited in Majeske II does indicate a distinction between clearly erroneous review of underlying facts and plenary review of the ultimate legal questions of compelling interest and narrow tailoring. 91 F.3d at 596. Contractors Association, however, concerned review of a district court grant of an injunction and therefore, as with any determination by the bench that requires express findings of fact, there were factual determinations that would be reviewed on a different standard than the legal determinations. The ordinary jury trial does not as clearly allow for such distinctions. Concrete Works was a summary judgment ruling and it simply stated the usual distinction between review of underlying factual determinations and review of the ultimate legal conclusion. 36 F.3d at 1522. Similarly, the trial court in Majeske followed Rule 49(a) procedures that allowed for two distinct levels of review: review of the jury's fact determinations and review of the legal conclusions the judge drew from those facts. See Freeman v. Chicago Park District, 189 F.3d 613, 616 (7th Cir.1999). Whether to use Rule 49(a) procedures is permissive, not mandatory. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(a) (""[t]he court may require a jury to return only a special verdict""); Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 171 (2d Cir. 1998). Majeske II does not mandate the type of special verdict employed in that case, nor does it mandate a more exacting level of review than that ordinarily employed in reviewing a jury verdict. To the extent the issue is raised on properly preserved motions for judgment as a matter of law, see generally Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, Majeske II only requires that the court make *920 the legal determination of whether the evidence before the jury was sufficient to support the jury's determinations as to compelling interests and narrow tailoring. The jury instructions are to state the appropriate legal standards and the jury is to make determinations within the confines of those instructions, with it further being presumed that the jury accurately and faithfully follows the instructions.
Moreover, even if Majeske II supports that review of the jury's determinations as to compelling interests and narrow tailoring is to be more demanding that the usual review of a jury verdict, that does not mean that special verdicts as to the underlying facts are mandatory. In First Amendment cases, the Supreme Court has held that ""reviewing courts have an obligation to conduct an `independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.'""

However, the seventh graders, my wonderful seventh graders, had such an increase that the school average as a whole didn’t drop. It flat lined, but it held steady. I thought the vice-principal was exaggerating when he said, “You single-handedly saved the school” – and I still do because test scores shouldn’t have that much power (but that’s a topic for another time).

However, the scores were impressive. My students gained between 10 and 30 percentile points on average depending on the category. Statistically staggering. “Resource” students became “regular” and “regular” became “honors” (much to the chagrin of some honors parents – but that’s yet another topic). It worked! But boy was I tired. I needed to make better use of technology to facilitate what I was doing. I had ideas of how that could happen, and I had the ear of the administration for sure.

However, those ideas came to a halt with the district’s response to legislation titled No Child Left Behind. They adopted a beautiful curriculum set that I was looking forward to implementing. However, it came with a lesson plan book that was pre-filled for the entire year. It also came with scripts. Yes, scripts of what to say. We were supposed to put the whole district on the same track to see how well the curriculum worked. If I did anything different, I would throw off the results of their study. But you already know how I feel about tracks. There’s also the issue of ethics. While I had one administrator suggesting that I could close my door and do my thing, a newer vice principal would come in and scold me.

I increasingly felt the urge to jump ship. And I did, right into the charter schools and other opportunities to continue developing personalized learning approaches. I earned the nickname “curriculum guru” and enjoyed invitations to review products and approaches. The homeschool families I mentored and my own daughters were excellent guinea pigs, and we would discuss ideas for a dream school.

I also tapped back into my previous experiences, from piloting a personalized learning program for “at risk” kids in 1997 to helping start a state-wide online school in 2006. What worked? More importantly, what didn’t?

I couldn’t find a school that met all of the criteria. The day finally came to gather all of my research, resources, and contacts with other change agents, and create a model school. I had been synthesizing everything I learned and created the Personalized Education Philosophy as part of a university course. I began connecting with key people I worked with in the past, including one who I took on as a business partner since he had a degree in business and experience as an administrator in",646,11, personalized learning programs.

$e^{i\theta}$ $=$ $\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$, a definition or theorem?

My question is simply whether the well-known formula $e^{i \theta}$ $=$ $\cos \theta$ $+$ $i \sin \theta$ a definition or there is some proof of the result. 
It seems to me that the formula is a definition (as is the case with the definition of $e$ from which the definition of $e^x$ can easily be derived). But if I try to form the definition in the same manner I have to us the definition from Complex Analysis. Is there any way to prove the result without using any ideas from Complex Analysis?

A:

It's a theorem.
Assuming that $e^z$ is defined as $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^n}{n!}$ (remember that there are a few ways of defining $e$), we have:
$$e^{i\theta}:=1+i\theta+\frac{\theta^2i^2}{2!}+\frac{\theta^3i^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^4i^4}{4!}+\frac{\theta^5i^5}{5!}+\cdots=$$
Simplifying this, we find that $$\boxed{e^{i\theta}\equiv1+i\theta-\frac{\theta^2}{2!}-\frac{i\theta^3}{3!}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!}+\frac{i\theta^5}{5!}-\cdots}$$
Now, $\color{blue}{\underbrace{\cos(\theta)=1-\frac{\theta^2}{2!}+\frac{\theta^4}{4!}-\frac{\theta^6}{6!}+\cdots}_{\text{Taylor expansion of} \cos(\theta)}}$.

Today, technology and consumer demand have produced mobile telephones of diminishing size. As the mobile telephones are produced smaller and smaller, the placement of the microphone during use ends up more and more distant from the speaker""""s (near-end user""""s) mouth. This increased distance increases the need for speech enhancement due to disruptive background noise being picked up at the microphone and transmitted to a far-end user. In other words, since the distance between a microphone and a near-end user is larger in the newer smaller mobile telephones, the microphone picks up not only the near-end user""""s speech, but also any noise which happens to be present at the near-end location. For example, the near-end microphone typically picks up sounds such as surrounding traffic, road and passenger compartment noise, room noise, and the like. The resulting noisy near-end speech can be annoying or even intolerable for the far-end user. It is thus desirable that the background noise be reduced as much as possible, preferably early in the near-end signal processing chain (e.g., before the received near-end microphone signal is supplied to a near-end speech coder).

40,0,20088,0,"Delta has just revealed a radical change to their Asian route network. This move further reinforces Delta’s heavy focus on their joint ventures, and in this case their joint venture with Korean Air.

Delta ending operations at Tokyo Narita

Tokyo Haneda is Tokyo’s more convenient airport, though historically it has had very limited slots available for US carriers. Recently the DOT tentatively granted an additional 12 slots to US airlines at Haneda.

The DOT sure acted in favor of Delta with these allocations, as Delta got five of the 11 available slots.

Delta was granted flights to Tokyo Haneda from Atlanta, Detroit, Honolulu, Portland, and Seattle. On top of that, the airline already flies from Los Angeles and Minneapolis to Haneda, meaning they’ll have service to Haneda from seven markets.

There was talk that this would lead to Delta completely leaving Narita. That’s not surprising, given that they were the weakest of the “big three” at the airport. American has close ties with Japan Airlines, while United has close ties with ANA. Delta, on the other hand, didn’t have a major partner at the airport.

Delta has now revealed that they plan to transfer their full operations of US to Tokyo services from Narita to Haneda. Delta notes that they’ll be the largest US airline serving Haneda, with seven daily flights.

The plan is for this change to take plane with the summer 2020 IATA flying season (which means in reality we should expect these changes in the spring).

Delta ending Tokyo to Singapore flight

As of September 22, 2019, Delta will discontinue their Tokyo Narita to Singapore flight. This is a flight that they’ve been operating for years, though the airline notes that the route has been under financial pressure as direct US to Singapore capacity has continued to grow, combined with local carriers having stronger brand loyalty and alliance partnerships.

It’s not at all surprising to see this cut, since it’s not like Delta’s only flight out of Narita was going to be out of Singapore. That flight was based around connections, so that just wouldn’t make sense.

As Delta notes, there are now many nonstops from the US to Singapore, and for those traveling with one stop, they can travel through Seoul Incheon on Delta’s joint venture partner, Korean Air.

Nonetheless it is noteworthy that the airline is pulling out of this market, especially since Delta cut flights to Hong Kong as of last year. Those are two major markets.

While United seems to be all about ultra long haul flying nowadays, it is interesting that Delta can’t make Hong Kong or Singapore work out of their Seattle hub, because they certainly have a geographical advantage.

Manila flight transfers from Narita to Incheon

Delta also operates a flight from Tokyo Narita to Manila (since they don’t fly nonstop from the US to Manila). With Narita service being cut, the airline also plans to convert their Narita to Manila flight into a Seoul Incheon to Manila flight as of March 2020.

So Delta will fly between Seoul Incheon and Manila daily as part of their joint venture with Korean Air, given that they’re not able to secure any Haneda slots for intra-Asia flying.

I’m not sure I even really get why they’re operating that flight. It seems that with their Korean Air joint venture that they could handle the capacity.

My take

Delta is in a really fortunate situation in terms of the slots they got at Tokyo Haneda. There is something to be said for being able to streamline everything at one airport, and by next year they’ll have the most slots at Haneda of any US airline.

With them pulling out of Narita, it also makes perfect sense that they’re ending flights to Singapore. It also makes sense that they’re transferring their",839,11," Manila flight from Narita to Incheon, though I"

Moreover, the transcript of the sentencing hearing shows that the court inquired whether defendants, including Brown, understood that they could plead ""partially guilty to a portion of this charge? They might deny putting the life in jeopardy by the POWER [sic] of a dangerous weapon."" Nevertheless, Brown stood on his plea, fully understanding that it required the court to impose a 25-year sentence. And the transcript contains nothing indicating that government counsel gave the court any definition of the charge. If this were all, I would be disposed to affirm.


27
But there is more. The court's inquiry that I have just quoted occurred at the time of sentencing, the plea having been taken a few days before. It was prompted by the following colloquy between the court and Brown's counsel:


28
""MR. PRATT: If your Honor please, there isn't any legal ground why sentence should not be pronounced but I would like to call your Honor's [sic] to the fact that the indictment charges that they assaulted the postmistress, which is technically true, but they didn't actually do any physical violence to her; the assault was wholly by means of a revolver WHICH COULD NOT BE FIRED (?)


29
THE COURT: There is no question but what they are pleading guilty to the charge, is there?


30
MR. PRATT: No, there isn't, your Honor. I just wanted to call your Honor's attention to the fact put the charge `assault,' that there wasn't any language `physical assault.'

A:

You're re-using id values in your HTML.  This is invalid markup and will likely lead to undefined behavior (probably different by browser as well).  Notice this element:
<div id=""hiden"" class=""categorry"">

Since this is essentially inside a loop (repeater, datalist, etc.) it's going to render multiple times to the page.  Instead of an id, use a class:
<div class=""hiden categorry"">

Then just change your jQuery selector:
$('.hiden')

Of course, now you also need to specifically identify which element you want to toggle.  You can do this by",862,11, traversing the DOM a little bit from the clicked element

                              A tax sale was approved on October 11, 2011, and the

Although *G. straminea* and *G. scabra* are rich in iridoids, chemical composition and traditional uses are different between the two species. *G. straminea* is used for treating rheumatic arthritis, while *G. scabra* is used for liver protection \[[@B6-molecules-25-01442],[@B14-molecules-25-01442]\]. *G. rhodantha* and *G. rigescens* usually are often confused in traditional medicine markets in southwest China. In fact, the former is good at treating cough and other throat illnesses that are caused by fever, and, while the latter is used for chronic liver disease, inflammatory skin diseases, and clearing away heat \[[@B9-molecules-25-01442],[@B13-molecules-25-01442]\]. Those cases showed that the identification of *Gentiana* species is crucial for keeping the clinical effect consistent and ensuring patients' medication safety.

*Gentiana* species show extremely high morphological similarity and their Chinese names of species are often used in confusion in the market (see sample information). Furthermore, the powder of medicinal materials of *Gentiana* species is difficult for achieving the identification. Although pharmacognosy morphology identification or microscopic identification based on inner structural composition features and the inclusions of medicinal materials may be used for this purpose \[[@B9-molecules-25-01442]\]; these works critically depend on personal experiences. In recent years, the researches regarding authenticity identification and discrimination of *Gentiana* and its relatives were focused on DNA barcoding, ISSR amplification, and other molecular identification technologies \[[@B18-molecules-25-01442],[@B19-molecules-25-01442],[@B20-molecules-25-01442],[@B21-molecules-25-01442]\]. In addition, chromatographic and mass-spectrometric techniques were applied for species classification \[[@B10-molecules-25-01442],[@B22-molecules-25-01442],[@B23-molecules-25-01442]\]. However, these methods need a complex process of extractions, tedious pretreatment, a great number of chemical reagents, waste time, and are expensive. A rapid, high-accurate, and green authenticity identification method needs to be established to ensure the effectiveness and safety of the clinical application of *Gentiana*. In the past few decades, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), Raman, and infrared (IR) spectroscopic have gained the attention of various botany scientists and pharmacognosists \[[@B23-molecules-25-01442],[@B24-molecules-25-01442],[@B25-molecules-25-01442],[@B26-molecules-25-01442]\].

In the zebrafish retina, *otx1*expression marks the putative stem cell zone of the ciliary margin, and is expanded in *apc*mutants \[[@B2]\]. Otx1 and Otx2 are also expressed in the developing vertebrate hypothalamus and label neural progenitors in the zebrafish hypothalamus. We observed increased *otx1*mRNA expression in the hypothalamus of *apc*mutants (not shown), and to provide a more quantitative measurement, we examined the number of cells labeled with an antibody that recognizes both Otx1 and Otx2. Within the hypothalamus, *apc*mutants showed a significant increase in Otx1/2-positive cells at 36 hpf (Figure [3B,C](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}), and this increase was rescued to wild-type levels by AG-490 incubation (Figure [3B,C](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}). These data suggest that cells may be arrested in an Otx-positive progenitor state following *apc*inactivation, and that Jak/Stat function mediates this arrest.

Inhibition of Jak/Stat activity is not sufficient to rescue neurogenesis in *apc*mutants
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While Jak/Stat activity is required for the expansion of CNS progenitor characteristics downstream of *apc*inactivation and *stat3*transcription, we hypothesized that this pathway is not likely to mediate all outputs of Wnt activation. Indeed, when we examined the expression of the Wnt target gene *axin2*, we observed a strong increase in mRNA expression that was not rescued by AG-490 incubation (Figure [4A](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}). This result indicates that many transcriptional targets of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling are likely to be independent of Jak/Stat activity, and that these targets may act in parallel pathways.

True Lies is a 1994 American action comedy film written, directed and co-produced by James Cameron and executive produced by Lawrence Kasanoff. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Art Malik, Tia Carrere, Bill Paxton, Eliza Dushku, Grant Heslov and Charlton Heston. It is based on the 1991 French comedy film La Totale! The film follows U.S. government agent Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger), who struggles to balance his life as a spy with his familial duties.

True Lies was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain",160,11,", which was co-founded by Cameron.

Comparison to other interfaces

Command-line interfaces 

Since the commands available in command line interfaces can be many, complex operations can be performed using a short sequence of words and symbols. This allows greater efficiency and productivity once many commands are learned, but reaching this level takes some time because the command words may not be easily discoverable or mnemonic. Also, using the command line can become slow and error-prone when users must enter long commands comprising many parameters or several different filenames at once. However, windows, icons, menus, pointer (WIMP) interfaces present users with many widgets that represent and can trigger some of the system's available commands.

GUIs can be made quite hard when dialogs are buried deep in a system, or moved about to different places during redesigns. Also, icons and dialog boxes are usually harder for users to script.

WIMPs extensively use modes, as the meaning of all keys and clicks on specific positions on the screen are redefined all the time. Command line interfaces use modes only in limited forms, such as for current directory and environment variables.

Most modern operating systems provide both a GUI and some level of a CLI, although the GUIs usually receive more attention. The GUI is usually WIMP-based, although occasionally other metaphors surface, such as those used in Microsoft Bob, 3dwm, or File System Visualizer.

GUI wrappers 
Graphical user interface (GUI) wrappers find a way around the command-line interface versions (CLI) of (typically) Linux and Unix-like software applications and their text-based user interfaces or typed command labels. While command-line or text-based application allow users to run a program non-interactively, GUI wrappers atop them avoid the steep learning curve of the command-line, which requires commands to be typed on the keyboard. By starting a GUI wrapper, users can intuitively interact with, start, stop, and change its working parameters, through graphical icons and visual indicators of a desktop environment, for example.
Applications may also provide both interfaces, and when they do the GUI is usually a WIMP wrapper around the command-line version. This is especially common with applications designed for Unix-like operating systems. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product's functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Designing programs this way also allows users to run the program in a shell script.

Three-dimensional user interfaces 

For typical computer displays, three-dimensional is a misnomer—their displays are two-dimensional. Semantically, however, most graphical user interfaces use three dimensions. With height and width, they offer a third dimension of layering or stacking screen elements over one another. This may be represented visually on screen through an illusionary transparent effect, which offers the advantage that information in background windows may still be read, if not interacted with. Or the environment may simply hide the background information, possibly making the distinction apparent by drawing a drop shadow effect over it.

Some environments use the methods of 3D graphics to project virtual three dimensional user interface objects onto the screen. These are often shown in use in science fiction films (see below for examples). As the processing power of computer graphics hardware increases, this becomes less of an obstacle to a smooth user experience.

Three-dimensional graphics are currently mostly used in computer games, art, and computer-aided design (CAD). A three-dimensional computing environment can also be useful in other uses, like molecular graphics, aircraft design and Phase Equilibrium",786,11, Calculations/Design of unit operations and chemical processes.

57,0,21267,0,"The summer is for cooling off at the beach, sipping piña coladas and for many, going to the farmers market. Over the past six years, the number of farmers markets has grown over 76 percent with a continual rise in interest for locally grown food. And, the summer season is the busiest time at the farmers markets as there is an overwhelmingly delicious array of colorful fruits and vegetables for sale.

Yet, as happy as it may be picking out all of that produce, come Friday the basil that was supposed to go in that night's dinner may be all black and the zucchini? It's covered with brown spots. But, there are ways to avoid these common farmers market conundrums. First, a couple of general tips that will make your purchases hit the dinner table instead of the trash can:

Go home right after the market. Don’t leave the produce in the car to run other errands or baking in the sun while getting breakfast. Head home and store them properly, as soon as you arrive.

Keep the produce out of sunlight once home.

Do not store fruits and vegetables together. Fruits give off high levels of ethylene gas, which ripens the fruits, causing them to change color, become softer, and sweeter. But it can quickly spoil surrounding vegetables.

There are so many varieties of fruits and vegetables at the summer market, but here are a few ways to help keep the summer's most popular produce last.

Peaches

It is best to pick out peaches that are on the firmer side unless they are to be eaten that day (and if that's the case, leave them in a bowl or basket on the kitchen counter away from sunlight.

To lengthen the life of the fruits, store them in the refrigerator in a low moisture drawer, but only with other fruits. The refrigerator does not make the fruit more or less ripe but simply stops the process in time. Take the peaches out the night before eating.

If to quicken the softening process, store them in a paper bag in a cool dark place, thereby trapping the ethylene gas. The paper bag trick is good for other fruits as well such as avocados and plantains.

Tomatoes

When choosing tomatoes, look for bruising, spotting or soft spots on the skin. If there are signs of any of these, do not buy them. Look for vibrant colors among the rainbowed assortment of tomatoes at the market. Touch is also a big indicator of a good tomato. The tomato should feel firm but still reacts to touch. Lastly, make sure the tomato smells like a tomato. If it smells funky or just not like a tomato it may be a sign that the tomato going bad.

When storing tomatoes, do not put them in the refrigerator. The refrigerator will turn that deliciously, juicy, farm fresh tomato into a meaty, tasteless, winter tomato. Refrigerating tomatoes damages the membranes in the fruit, which causes the tomatoes to lose flavor. If the refrigerator is the only option, let the tomato sit out a day before using.

59,0,20495,0,"Prague, 20 December 2001 (RFE/RL) -- Commentary in the Western press is dominated by the situation in Afghanistan, following the approval yesterday of a draft resolution by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council on the deployment of a British-led security force to Afghanistan. The full council is expected to vote on the force as early as today. It's hoped the first troops will be in place in and around Kabul by Saturday, 22 December -- the day the Afghan interim government, led by Hamid Karzai, is to take power.

Other issues include debating the so-called Phase II of the antiterrorism campaign and the conflict in the Middle East.

THE TIMES:

An editorial in ""The Times"" of London considers yesterday's UN draft resolution on a security force for Afghanistan. Britain will have day-to-day control over the operation, but U.S. troops will stand ready to evacuate them, if necessary. The Pentagon will also have the authority to ensure the mission does not interfere with U.S. military objectives.

But the paper calls the peacekeeping mission ""a risky and uncertain venture"" and says there are fundamental conflicts within the operation. It will be difficult to define the force's relations with the American-led force on the ground still fighting the remnants of the Taliban. ""Confusion between the two forces, either by the Afghans or in the command structure, would be disastrous. Peacekeeping and war-making are different jobs that will be difficult to carry out at the same time,"" says the paper.

But ""The Times"" says it is necessary for the U.S. to have a ""decisive say"" in military operations. It notes that Germany does not agree ""and is already arguing that the peacekeeping force must be independent of the American command. [This] is a recipe for confusion and mistrust,"" writes the paper. ""The peacekeeping force can play a role, but only if the Americans, the Afghans and the contributing nations understand what it is there to do and how it will stabilize a post-Taliban Afghanistan.""

These treatments invariably begin with the assumption that standard quantum mechanics is a fundamental law of nature and then proceed with interpreting its consequences. In this essay I take the point of view that quantum mechanics is a model, a human invention, created to help us describe and understand our world and then proceed to address the more philosophical question posed above, a question that is still pondered by some physicists and philosophers and certainly by many physics students when they first encounter quantum mechanics. Most of the latter group eventually come to some understanding, perhaps via the ubiquitous Copenhagen Interpretation, and then proceed according to the maxim “Shut up and calculate!""[^2] One modest aim of this essay is to provide such students with a heuristic perspective on quantum mechanics that might enable them to proceed to calculations without first having to “shut up"".

What’s Quantized?
=================

Let us begin by asking where the ‘quantum’ in quantum mechanics comes from. What is it that’s quantized? That matter is composed of discrete quanta, atoms, was contemplated by Greek philosophers in the $5^{th}$ century B.C.[@Be2011] and the idea continued to be espoused through the $18^{th}$ century. Even though it wasn’t until the $19^{th}$ and early $20^{th}$ centuries that the existence of atoms was placed on a firm empirical basis, it’s not difficult to imagine what led early philosophers to an atomistic model. Perhaps the primary motivation, an argument that still resonates today, was to address the puzzle of change, i.e., the transformation of matter. This was often expressed by the assertion that things cannot come from nothing nor can they ever return to nothing. Rather, creation, destruction, and change are most simply explained by the rearrangement of the atomic constituents of matter. In his epic poem [*De rerum natura*]{} (On the Nature of Things, circa 55 BC), Lucretius[^3] explained (translation by R. Melville[@Lu55])

>...no single thing returns to nothing but at its dissolution everything returns to matter’s primal particles...they must for sure consist of changeless matter. For if the primal atoms could suffer change...then no more would certainty exist of what can be and what cannot...Nor could so oft the race of men repeat the nature, manners, habits of their parents.

While it took nearly 2500 years, the conjectures of the atomists were largely justified.

One might also reasonably ask, “Are there other aspects of nature that are quantized?"" It’s no coincidence that during the same period that saw the confirmation of the atomic hypothesis, there appeared evidence for the discrete nature of atomic interactions. Perhaps the first clues were the early $19^{th}$ century observations by Wollaston and Fraunhofer of discrete absorption lines in the spectrum",616,11, of the sun and the subsequent identification of emission lines in
62,0,27514,1025," I was doing was also bullying. I had been bullied before and then I was just making a reason just to say, ‘Well I’m defending people,’ but I was using brutality to make people pay for brutality and I’m not proud of that.”

Lopez says that, as his reputation grew among his cohorts, his parents were none the wiser. “I was very calm in front of my parents, very calm in front of adults. But when the night came, or when it was just us kids, I was really bad.”

Eventually Lopez found himself in a situation that exposed to his parents, and everyone else, exactly what kind of trouble he had been getting into. It was a situation, he says, that almost got him killed.

“There was a story on the radio, on television, in magazines, that I was dead,” claims Lopez in an ominous tone, as he lays out the tale of how one of his superhero missions culminated in a blood-soaked beating. A beating so bad, that it convinced eye-witnesses that the young man was dead.

When the teenage Lopez wasn’t street-fighting he was, more often than not, at either wrestling or rugby practice (a sport he also competed in at the national level). One day after rugby practice, Lopez’s girlfriend visited him at home. She was upset.

He asked her what was wrong and the girl cried that her little brother was being bullied by a boy named Joe.

“She said to me, ‘I don’t want you to fight, because I don’t like it when you fight, but please can you talk to this guy, because my little brother is getting bullied really bad.’”

Lopez heard her out and told her that he would try and ‘negotiate’ with Joe, to convince him to stop bullying her brother. Although, he wasn’t really interested in talking to the bully.

As he learned more about Joe, Lopez became more intent on fighting him. He heard Joe was a big guy, and tough too. “I was loving the challenge,” says Lopez, referring to the days leading up to the inevitable confrontation. They were days he spent in something not too dissimilar to a fight camp; training and strategizing for his opponent.

Lopez breaks the flow of his story, washes the taste of excitement from his mouth, and states, “When I’m thinking about that, it’s hard for me because I am embarrassed by the things that I am saying.”

In a more somber tone he continues, “I had the feeling that [fighting Joe] was something just. That this was justice for me. Joe was not a criminal, he was a kind of guy like me, I don’t think he was really a bad guy, not a gangster. But he was bullying weak people. For me, I loved to fight people who were bullying other people. I saw that I was making justice, but I was wrong.”

After a rugby match, Lopez decided it was time to seek out Joe. So he and some friends got in a taxi and headed to the Biyem-Assi, a nighbourhood on in west side Yaoundé.

Biyem-Assi was unincorporated land until the 1980s, when a population explosion brought in 300,000 citizens. On the night Lopez’s taxi snaked around the Rond point express and past the acacia tree studded markets, the streets were lively; with groups of men milling outside snack bars and beer halls, illuminated by moonlight, cigarette embers, and the occasional dim glow of a neon shop sign.

On foot, he and his friends found Joe. “I knew that right away I had to impose myself, physically. And I’m ashamed of that,” Lopez now admits.

The short, but thickly muscled, Lopez stepped to Joe with a cool demeanor; showing he was there to talk. The friends on either side fell away, giving the boys space to work out their issues.

Lopez took a breath, and asked, “Why did you do this to...”

Before he even finished the sentence, Lopez pounced and a brawl ensued. The well rounded martial artist, national level wrestler and rugby player, made short work of his large, but unrefined adversary. With Joe defeated, Lopez walked back to his friends.

He and his buddies headed back to the taxi ranks, chattering about what they’d witnessed, as if they were describing it to people who weren’t there. When they got",1010,11," to the taxis, Lopez felt a tap on the shoulder"

While the method is capable of handling any head-on collision system (symmetric or non-symmetric), the uranium system was chosen on the basis of planned experiments. Previous searches for supercritical resonances used partially ionized projectiles and solid targets [@PhysRevLett.51.2261; @PhysRevLett.56.444; @PhysLettB.245.153]. The ground state had a high percentage of being occupied, thus damping the supercritical resonance decay signal significantly due to Pauli-blocking. Over the next decade the GSI-FAIR collaboration is planning to perform bare uranium-uranium merged-beam collisions. A search will be conducted for supercritical resonance decay and for the nuclear sticking effect. Therefore, the present work will aid these investigations by providing more complete spectrum calculations.

The limitation to zero-impact-parameter collisions is caused by the computational complexity. While this implies that direct comparison with experiment will not be possible, we note that small-impact-parameter collisions will yield similar results [@PhysRevA.37.1449].

Theory
======

The information about the state of a collision system is contained in the single-particle Dirac amplitudes. They are obtained by expanding the time-evolved state into a basis with direct interpretation, namely the target-centered single-ion basis. These amplitudes, $a_{\nu,k}$, can be used to obtain the particle creation spectra [@PhysRevA.45.6296; @pra10324].

The total electron production spectrum, $n_k$, and positron production spectrum, $\bar{n}_q$, where $k$ and $q$ label positive and negative (discretized) energy levels respectively, are given by $$\begin{aligned}
\label{creat2}
\langle n_k \rangle &=& \sum_{\nu<F}{|a_{\nu,k}|^2} \\ \label{creat1}
\langle \bar{n}_q\rangle &=& \sum_{\nu>F}{|a_{\nu,q}|^2}.\end{aligned}$$ Here the coefficients are labeled such that $\nu$ represents the initial state and $F$ is the Fermi level [@PhysRevA.37.1449; @PhysRevA.45.6296]. Equations \[creat2\] and \[creat1\] contain sums over all the propagated initial states above (positrons) or below (electrons) the Fermi level, which is placed below the ground state separating the negative-energy states from the bound and positive-energy continuum states.

Therefore, all initial positive-energy states (both bound and continuum) must be propagated through the collision to calculate the total positron spectrum, which is obtained from vacancy production in the initially fully occupied Dirac sea. The dominant contribution (and a first approximation) to this spectrum is obtained by the propagation of the initial 1S state only [@eddiethesis]. Müller *et al.* [@PhysRevA.37.1449] reported partial positron spectra for bare U-U collisions by propagating a number of initial bound-state vacancies.

Propagating all the (discretized) states is accomplished in the present work by solving the time-independent Dirac equation (for many intermediate separations) using a matrix representation. The wavefunction is first expanded into spinor spherical harmonics, $\chi_{\kappa,\mu}$, $$\Psi_{\mu}(r,\theta,\phi)=\sum_{\kappa}{ \left(
\begin{array}{c}
G_{\kappa}(r)\chi_{\kappa,\mu}(\theta,\phi) \\
iF_{\kappa}(r)\chi_{-\kappa,\mu}(\theta,\phi)
\end{array}
\right)} \quad,$$ which are labeled by the relativistic angular quantum number $\kappa$ and the magnetic quantum number $\mu$",936,11, [@greiner]. The Dirac equation for the

An inveterate funder of leftist causes around the world, and paymaster of the US Democratic Party, Soros is often seen as the puppet master of the Obama Administration and responsible for many of the problems that beset the West.

While I have no doubt that Soros is every bit as malevolent as his opponents paint him, I think it is dangerous to assume that he is at the top of the of the anti American food chain.

It is important to know if Barack Obama works for George Soros, but even more vital to understand who George Soros may work for.

There is no doubt that Soros has heavily promoted communist and socialist causes in several countries. Is that because Soros hates America so much, that he is willing fund its enemies? Or is it because Soros himself is part of a very much alive, but low profile communist apparatus?

Let’s look at that possibility.

Commentators have pointed out that in order for George Soros to have achieved what he did in his early days, he must have been favored by the communists. The following observations have been made by prominent Czech former dissident leader Petr Cibulka.

George Soros as a young man traded currencies on the black market during the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Soros lived there until 1946 when he left the country as it was under Soviet occupation and he, without money and at age of 16, ended up in London, U.K. in 1947. According to claims Soros has made, he left his native Hungary because of the Soviet occupation. Simply said, this must be explained to the American public because these facts are not possible to be true under any normal circumstances. Soros admits to trade currencies on the black market, but that was always punishable by death during the Nazi era in any occupied country. Also what is important is the allegation that the Soros family collaborated with the Hungarian Nazi regime during WW2.

Can sport - which, by definition, is practical (score runs, take wickets) and competitive (beat the other guy) - belong to the same sphere as painting, literature and music?

The debate is not helped by the fact that sport and the arts are usually portrayed as antagonistic opposites - athletes v aesthetes, hearties v arties, jocks v thespians. From school to adult life, it is often (wrongly) assumed that there is little overlap between artistic creators and sporting competitors. (Writers, in fact, are often just as fiercely competitive as sportsmen.)

And yet no one (well,",169,11, almost no one) disputes that sport can be beautiful.

Mice with global deletion of *Trpc6* grow normally and have no apparent defects in major organ systems at baseline^[@R30]^. Consistently, we found that the baseline heart mass index was not different between mice with global deletion of *Trpc6* and control wild-type littermates ([Fig. 3a](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}). Deletion of *Trpc6* partially protected against ISO-induced cardiac remodeling, but completely prevented the exaggerated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy in Klotho-deficient mice. Consistent with these results, deletion of *Trpc6* attenuated ISO-induced increases in *ANP* and *BNP* mRNA, and abolished the exaggerated ISO-induced increases in the mRNA in Klotho-deficient mice ([Fig. 3b, c](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}).

We further investigated cardioprotection by Klotho using transgenic mice that overexpress TRPC6 in hearts. Mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of TRPC6 develop spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy and also have heightened sensitivity to stress-induced hypertrophy^[@R16]^. We crossed mice with cardiac TRPC6 overexpression with transgenic mice overexpressing Klotho to create double transgenic mice, and compared the survival rate, heart mass index, and cardiac fetal gene expression of double transgenic mice with those of having cardiac overexpression of TRPC6 and with wild-type littermates. Compared to wild-type littermates at 24 months of age, cardiac TRPC6-overexpressing mice had decreased survival and increased heart mass index and cardiac fetal gene expression without ISO treatment ([Fig. 3d--f](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}). Klotho overexpression tended to improve the survival of cardiac TRPC6-overexpressing mice, prevented the increase in heart mass, and markedly diminished the increase in fetal gene expression induced by overexpression of TRPC6 in hearts. These studies also support the notion that Klotho protects the heart by inhibiting cardiac TRPC6.

Soluble Klotho inhibits TRPC6 in isolated cardiac myocytes {#S6}

Klotho is not expressed in the heart. We tested the hypothesis that soluble Klotho present in the systemic circulation mediates the inhibition of cardiac TRPC6. TRPC6 is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)^[@R15]^. We examined TRPC6 channel activity in freshly isolated ventricular myocytes by whole-cell patch-clamp recording using stimulation by endothelin-1 (ET1) to release DAG ([Fig. 4a](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}).

ISO treatment increased TRPC6-mediated currents in wild-type hearts ([Fig. 4a, b](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}); the role of TRPC6 is supported by the facts that the increase was eliminated in *Trpc6*-knockout mice ([Fig. 4b](#F4){ref-type=""fig""}), and identical currents were seen in TR",790,11,PC6-overexpressing hearts ([Fig.

76,0,21091,0,"Having had bantams for three years now, I’ve found a lot of positives and negatives to choosing mini chickens over big ones. There’s been times where I’ve wished I had gone with large chickens, and times when I’m said I’m so glad I didn’t. Like whenever I get crapped on. I am always glad for mini chickens then.

When choosing the types of chickens you want you have lots of size options, ranging from less than 1 pound to upwards of 13 pounds (yes, seriously). They’re generally broken down into two size categories though: Bantams and large fowl. Large fowl fall into light, medium, and heavy while bantams technically fit into two types: True bantams and miniatures. True bantams have more or less always been small and have no larger counterpart, while miniatures have been bred down from large chickens. Miniatures are generally slightly larger than true bantams. Bantams can range anywhere from the tiniest Class A Seramas (a true bantam) to the Orpington bantams (a miniature) and Silkies (a true bantam), which are nearly the size of small large fowl chicken.

Miniaturizing isn’t really a taboo thing in chickens like it is in dogs. I’m guessing that’s because it’s not really socially frowned upon to eat them if you change your mind. Eat the chickens that is, not the people who get all nitpicky about miniaturizing. I mean the American Poultry Association even recognizes bantam Jersey Giants as a breed, which is kind of an oxymoron.

Just like with large fowl chickens, the egg-laying abilities of bantams vary a great deal so it’s hard to say which size make better layers. As with all chickens they are their most productive until 2 years old, then productivity slows down with age. The egg-laying abilities of chickens could almost be its own post, but I’ll try to summarize everything in one paragraph. Just skip down to the bold lettering if egg numbers don’t interest you. I promise it won’t hurt my feelings.

Commercial hybrids are, in my opinion, in a separate class. Nothing, neither large fowl nor bantam, can compete with them for total eggs laid during the first two years, but the hybrids’ production drops off so rapidly after two years they’re not necessarily the best choice for backyard pets with benefits (harr harr). Heritage breeds will lay less eggs per week, but generally lay better over the years so they are a better choice for someone who plans on keeping their chickens for their entire natural lifespan while still wanting a few eggs. Bantams miniaturized from large fowl breeds that are exceptional (eggs-ceptional?) layers are likely to lay lots of eggs as well while the bantams from lower production large fowl will also likely be lower production. Still following? Awesome. Many of the true bantams will lay in the ballpark of 3-4 eggs per week, although some can be as low as 2-3 per week and some will lay 5-6. Then there are Silkies, which while technically not bad layers are so prone to going broody that many of them they hardly lay any eggs at all. As with anything it’s important to research your breeds, and the individual lines within a breed, to ensure you’re getting the best fit for your needs.

Maybe it’s a good thing that more and more airlines are charging to chow down on their mediocre meals. FDA reports uncovered by USA Today reveals the unappetizing conditions at some of the kitchens that prepare the overpriced grub.

At the Denver kitchen for LSG Sky Chefs, the largest caterer for airline food, inspectors found cockroach carcasses “too numerous to count,” not to mention that the kitchen floor tested positive for everyone’s favorite bacteria, Listeria.

Via the Freedom of Information Act, USA Today requested FDA inspection reports for the kitchens operated by LSG as well as those operated by second-largest caterer Gate Gourmet and another large caterer, Flying Food Group. Together, these three operations run 91 kitchens and prepare over 100 million meals to the airline industry each year.

Of the 46 inspection reports received by USA Today thus far, 27 of them were flagged for violations by the FDA. Among the less-appetizing:

â€¢At the LSG facility in Minneapolis, inspectors found a mouse, rodent nesting materials and rodent feces under a pallet of food and elsewhere in the kitchen.

â€¢Gate Gourmet’s Dulles, VA, facility of Gate Gourmet, was cited for failing to keep shrimp, filet mignon, Chilean sea bass, chicken and vegetables, and pastrami and cheese sandwiches at the proper temperature. And even after the inspector pointed this out to employees, the shrimp and the pastrami and cheese sandwiches were not thrown in the garbage.

Luckily for everyone, airline cost-cutting and higher prices for food are having a positive impact on the quality of the food coming from these kitchens.

Says an FDA rep, who knows to never order the fish dish:

With less ready-to-eat fresh food offered in coach class and substitution with prepackaged, shelf-stable foods, the opportunity for poor preparation, storing foods at improper temperatures and food-handling violations is much lower.

They all offer this type of ‘gourmet food’ but tends to be less than….er, appetizing. I normally upgrade my flight to China (since avoiding 16 hrs in coach is worth all the miles I can save in a year) and always eat the ‘filet mignon.’ Is it beef? Maybe, sort of…but certainly the only steak where I use ketchup to mask the taste (or lack thereof). So yes, they may have Chilean sea bass, but it probably won’t look, smell or taste like the actual fish! ;)

Gold category Welschriesling items, sparkling sunshine, magnificent panorama and people loosening up more and more thanks to the light wines. At the fiesta organized around the first public tasting of Csopak's 2013 wines, we asked the minds behind the Csopak Codex, István Jásdi and Tamás Kovács about this year's harvest and the characteristics of a good Welschriesling from Csopak.

Last Saturday, you could enjoy wine tastings and wine cellar tours at 5 venues in Csopak and at 1 location in Paloznak, all-day-long. In addition to Jásdi Winery (boasting of a picturesque panorama) and the Szent Donát Winehouse, the Söptei, the Koralevics and the Petrányi wineries of Csopak and the Homola in Paloznak received and entertained a flow guests.

After this year's rainy summer, next year's autumn will definitely arrive with less good wine - this is already considered a certainty among the majority of Csopak's winemakers. But let us not rush forward, because there is still reason to celebrate this year! The weather in 2013 was favourable for the Welschriesling as well as for a lot of other varieties. The independent jury rewarded 13 wines of the 2013 vintage with the highest, Vinea Csopak Nobilis Districtus (VDNC Csopak) qualification.

You know how sometimes when you first play a game, something about the way it looks on the screen, how it controls, and the way it rewards you causes something to click in your brain where you know without a doubt that you’ll be playing the very same game years from now? Yeah? Well, I imagine this is very much how the multiplayer in LightBox Interactive’s Starhawk is going to be for a lot of people. For those who don’t know, Starhawk is a sort of spiritual successor to 2007’s popular third-person online shooter with vehicles and aircraft, Warhawk. It has similar third-person gunplay, there’s still a bunch of vehicles, and it’s a huge, online frag-fest. It’s the kind of game that’s so easy to understand and fun to play that if you’ve ever played video games before, it just sort of explains itself.

The basic premise is that you’re a member of one of two factions, and you engage the opposing one to compete in various game types on various maps. At the time I played, only “Capture the Flag” and “Team Deathmatch” game types were available, but there also seems to be a non-team “Deathmatch” and some sort of zone-based game as well. The rules of these games are basically the same in any title, and thankfully, Starhawk doesn’t really stray from this. It makes it really easy to know what to do at any given time, and allows you to focus on play style and strategy rather than a set of confusing and arbitrary rules.

The gameplay on foot is also delightfully simple. You have a gun, and you can grab others off the map. There’s a button for you to aim down the sight and another to fire. You can change weapons with the D-Pad. There’s also the customary grenade and melee attack buttons, two other classic standbys of the genre. It was great to be able to drop down into the map and pretty much know completely how to play without ever having to be taught or looking at a manual.

Vehicle controls are also smooth and intuitive. There’s a buggie that’s satisfyingly similar to Halo’s classic Warthog, a fun jetpack that makes you feel super sneaky, and of course, the Hawks — giant walking mechs that have a whole arsenal of weapon pick-ups of their own and can transform into an space fighter at the click of a button. These are obviously the main draw of the game, as they are genuinely neat to fly but not over-powered. My first time in the air, I was already able to make strafing runs and avoid enemy fire with ease.

Another cool and intuitive feature new to Starhawk is something LightBox is calling the “Build & Battle” system. Basically, as time goes on in the match and you rack up XP, you also gain points for building structures — anything from a basic wall, to a bunker, to a a launch pad complete with a Hawk. You can do this in real time without pausing gameplay by pressing the triangle button, which changes the camera angle and enables you to cycle through a choice wheel with all the building options using the left stick. You can then just run around and place it wherever you want, where it drops from the sky with a beautiful animation. “Build & Battle” adds a clever RTS element to play without sacrificing the feeling of playing a shooter.

As easy and intuitive as all the gameplay features are, this game separates itself from some others like it with attention to detail. For example, it’s precisely balanced to allow various styles of play. Sure, Hawks are strong, but they can easily be defeated by someone on foot as long as they can find a handheld missile launcher. The turrets and other stuff you can build are the perfect midpoint between easily able to kill you and easily killable. Vehicles, walls, and sniper towers are cheap to build and enable dynamic battles every time rather than one-sided massacres. When you enter the battlefield, you do so in a pod via airdrop, and you can slightly change the trajectory of your descent, encouraging you to try and crush opponents on your way down, so even if you die a lot you can rack up kills.

Part Warhawk, part Battlefield 1942, part Star Wars: Battlefront, part Tribes, part Transformers: War For Cybertron — Starhawk is sure to become something of a multiplayer institution when it drops on May 8th. Can’t wait to see the single-player campaign in action.

“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”

– Ben Franklin

At Stellar, our core mission is to leverage education and local knowledge to extend financial access to the 2.5 billion unbanked people worldwide. We do this through a technology that enables money to move directly between people, companies and financial institutions as easily as email, increasing interoperability between diverse financial systems and currencies. Mobile economic tools that can span wide geographic areas at a low cost are a critical component of our efforts. And as we explore powerful ways to alleviate poverty through digital financial services, we need to think in particular about how those tools can reach women and girls.

Why girls?

In many cultures, it’s hard to separate a woman’s identity from her economic relationships with others – so lack of access to financial services serves to perpetuate gender inequality.

In the developing world, only 37 percent of women have bank accounts. Research from Women’s World Banking has shown that poor women are inherent savers, putting away 10-15 percent of their earnings for emergencies. Due to a lack of financial services, however, they’re forced to save in unreliable and sometimes expensive ways — women often hide cash in their homes, where it isn’t secure, or buy livestock, which can become ill or die.

Starting early in a woman’s life, there’s a long list of factors that hinder financial inclusion, including minimum age requirements, lack of formal identification, distance to banks, and difficulty securing permission from familial authorities or other cultural gatekeepers. On top of that, when they do have bank accounts, girls in particular are less likely to maintain hefty balances. Commercial financial institutions are reluctant to design services for small savers, whose accounts they’ve traditionally viewed as prohibitively costly to administer.

We believe that low-cost and reliable methods for saving could have an enormous impact on girls, as well as on their families and communities. Saving not only improves the financial well-being of girls but also nurtures positive attitudes and expectations, building self-esteem and driving productive behavioral changes.

How Vumi reaches women

When Stellar began digging into this issue, we met the team at the Praekelt Foundation, an amazing nonprofit based in South Africa that has been using open-source technologies to deliver essential information and inclusive services to millions of people living in poverty. Since its founding, Praekelt’s programs have reached over 50 million people across 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Using Stellar’s open-source protocol, Praekelt is working on a mobile wallet that allows people to save money using Vumi, its messaging platform—think WhatsApp, but open source and designed for the developing world, with a focus on improving the economic security of girls in South Africa. Vumi already powers South Africa’s national maternal health care program, MomConnect, which sends expectant mothers prenatal health information over the course of their pregnancies. After a successful launch in South Africa last year, Praekelt is introducing the service in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.

Personal savings accounts for girls

Vumi’s savings program, a pilot program launching soon in South Africa with plans to expand to Kenya and Nigeria, encourages early financial literacy. With a particular focus on formal savings for girls, Vumi’s financial infrastructure allows anyone to open a personal savings account. For many in the program, especially girls, Vumi may be their first formal savings account.

84,0,20134,2050," to $k_B \ln N$. So we expect the description in terms of the Heisenberg model to be accurate when the entropy is below $k_B \ln N$. For $SU(2)$, this is a severe restriction for experiments since $\ln 2\simeq 0.693...$, but already for $SU(3)$, this is less of a problem since $\ln 3 \simeq 1.099$. Of course, this is not the whole story since what really matters is the entropy below which specific correlations develop, but this is an additional motivation to consider $SU(N)$ models with $N>2$.

[*Exact results.—*]{} A number of exact results that have been obtained over the years on the 1D $SU(N)$ Heisenberg model will prove to be useful. The model has been solved with Bethe ansatz by Sutherland[@Sutherland_SUN]. He showed that, in the thermodynamic limit, the energy per site is given by $$E_0(N)=2\sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k\zeta(k)}{N^k}-1,$$ where $\zeta$ is the Riemann’s zeta function. Some values are given in Tab. \[tab:energies\_SUN\]. In addition, he showed that there are $N-1$ branches of elementary excitations which all have the same velocity $v=2\pi/N$ at small $k$. Affleck has argued that the central charge $c$ should be equal to $N-1$[@affleck_1988], and Lee has shown that[@Lee_SUN], at low temperature $T$, the entropy is given by: $$S(T)=\frac{k_BN(N-1)}{6}T+O(T^2),
    \label{eq:entropy_slope}$$ a direct consequence of $c=N-1$ and $v=2\pi/N$ since the linear coefficient is equal to $\pi c/3v$.

[*The QMC algorithm.—*]{} Quantum Monte-Carlo is the most efficient method to study the finite temperature properties of interacting systems provided one can find a basis where there is no minus sign problem, i.e. a basis in which all off-diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are non-positive. For the $SU(2)$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on bipartite lattices, this is easily achieved by a spin-rotation by $\pi$ on one sublattice. For $SU(N)$ with $N>2$, there is no such general solution, but in 1D one can get rid of the minus sign on a chain with open boundary conditions, as already noticed for the SU(4) model[@frischmuth_1999].

THE EAST IS RED #22 – Mystics in Bali (1981)

by Lisa Morton

Back in 1998, there was a book that came out called ""Mondo Macabro"" by Pete Tombs that rocked my cinematic world. The book’s subtitle – ""Weird and Wonderful Cinema Around the World"" – gives you just the tiniest hint of the wonders that are to be found in this amazing tome. Where most other books on cult or exploitation movies were covering the same old tired ground (really, how many essays praising Herschell Gordon Lewis as an auteur do we need?) and revisiting movies we’d not only heard of but actually seen, Mondo",154,11, Macabro was presenting us with stuff like Indian horror

The scaling relation means that the rescaled data $\tilde{\kappa}^{\rm data}_{n}$ will only be sensitive to $\left(\tau_{f}/\tau_{\rm KZ}, \theta_{\rm KZ}\right)$. In another word, let us rescale an ensemble of experimental data in heavy-ion collisions with different beam energy $\sqrt{s}$, impact parameter $b$ (or centrality) and rapidity $\eta$ using the appropriate power of $l_{KZ}$ according to, those collisions with the similar $\left(\tau_{f}/\tau_{\rm KZ}, \theta_{\rm KZ}\right)$ will have approximately the similar values for rescaled data if the QCD critical regime is probed by those collisions.

A crucial step in testing scaling as outlined above is to determine $l_{KZ}, \tau_{KZ},\theta_{KZ}$ and the freeze-out time $\tau_{f}$ as a function of $\left(\sqrt{s}, b, \eta\, \right)$. We need to use hydrodynamical simulations to determine trajectories in the phase diagram as well as the expansion rate of the system for a given collision of $\left(\sqrt{s}, b, \eta\,\right)$. We then compare the relaxation time and quench time to determine the corresponding $l_{KZ}\left(\sqrt{s}, b, \eta\, \right)$, $\tau_{KZ}\left(\sqrt{s}, b, \eta\,\right)$, $\theta_{KZ}\left(\sqrt{s}, b, \eta\,\right)$. Since those scaling variables are non-trivial functions of $\left(\sqrt{s}, b, \eta\, \right)$, the success of such theory-data comparisons would provide strong evidence for the existence of the QCD critical point. The study of procedures outlined above, with examples including mock BES data is in progress [@search].\

Some Issues About Cygwin[Linux in Windows] (socket,thread,other programming and shell issues)

I have some question about cygwin  :

Can I use Cygwin develop socket based code? 
Does Cygwin have read() and write() functions that work with file descriptors?
Can I use Pthread library in Cygwin?
Does code that compiles in Cygwin also
compile in Linux without any change or with little change?
Will an executable file that built by
Cygwin run in Linux?
Why does Cygwin not need the linker
option -lpthread when I use pthread library?
why in #include <iostream> don't I need to use using namespace std;?
Can I work with QT in Cygwin?  If so,How?
Can I boot my Linux in other
partition with Cygwin and use it?
Can I access the other partition
 that is EXT3 in Cygwin?

A:

On 1: 
Yes.  Socket libraries are shipped with Cygwin - many socket based apps such as web servers are included in the base distribution.
On 2: 
Yes.  I think all of the'section 2 and 3' system calls in the GNU C runtime and library are implemented by the cygwin runtume.  You can check this in the man pages that come with Cygwin.  A list of system calls and std lib calls implementd by Cygwin can be found here.
On 3: Yes. Pthread is included in Cygwin.  The list referred to in the link above mentions pthreads as well.
On 4: Anything built against GNU libraries should work with little or no change between Cygwin and Linux (assuming there are no dependencies missing on Cygwin).  Depending on CPU architecture you may have to worry about word alignment, endianness and other architecture-specific porting issues, but if you're targeting Windows and Linux on Intel your code would have few if any porting issues arising from CPU architecture.
On 5: Cygwin will build a program against its own shared libraries by default but GCC can cross-compile to target other platforms.   You could (in theory) set GCC up to cross-compile to any target supported by the compiler.  There are plenty of resources on the web about cross-compiling with GCC, and I don't think the process will be materially different on Cygwin.
Note that Cygwin binaries will not run on Linux - or Vice-versa.  You will still need separate builds for both.
On 6: Not sure - at a guess it's included in the standard runtime, perhaps because it was necessary to wrap the Win32 threading API for some reason.
On 7: Don't know - it's probably the same on g++ on all platforms.  Apparently a compiler bug.  Dan Moulding's Answer covers this in more detail.
On 8: Yes.  IIRC QT is available in the standard builds and it will certainly compile on Cygwin.  As with Linux/Unix, QT on Cygwin uses an X11 backend so you will need to have an X server such as XMing running.  
In order to avoid the dependency on an X server you may want to build QT apps against the Win32 API,.  It is possible to do this with MinGW, which is a set of header files and libraries to build native Win32 apps with GCC.  MinGW can be used from within a Cygwin environment (an example of GCC on Cygwin cross-compiling to a non-Cygwin target) and the installer from cygwin.com gives you the option of installing it.  
MinGW is quite mature; it has all of the 'usual suspects' - libraries and header files you would expect to find on a",841,11, Unix/Linux GCC development environment and is very stable.

Ezra Soiferman: Mike Patterson comes from a long line of Canadian kind of goofball, oddball, big, lovable, friendly, accessible comedians. John Candy comes to mind. And Mike, I had seen him performing here and there over the years. He lived in my neighborhood with his brother for a little while. And then a friend was directing a short film that starred Mike. And I worked on that as a camera guy back, must’ve been about 15 years ago. So we met and talked and hung out during that shoot. And then this was about 2013 or so. Edibles were starting to catch on in California. Colorado would soon have legalized recreational right around that time.

I basically knew that edibles was going to be something that would ramp up rapidly and become a huge option for patients and for consumers. And I wanted to make a TV series about edibles, exploring that world. So I went to a production company in Montreal. It’s a big Canadian production company, and they do really successful and creative stuff. And told them the idea. They loved the idea of doing this kind of survey of the edibles world. But we were trying to focus it down. And we said, “Maybe if we find a host, the host can help us focus it.” I actually put forward Mike’s name as a potential host. They liked the idea. But we had a number of different names. And then coincidentally, a couple of days later, I bumped into Mike Patterson at a theater, the Segal Center in Montreal, where I used to work, after a play I was seeing there. He was in the lobby. He had just finished performing in … I’m forgetting the name. Always be closing. What the heck’s that thing? Anyhow, some awesome play that I’m spacing on.

Some of your listeners will know Always Be Closing. It’s Glengarry Glen Ross. He was starring in that. And Mike and I talked in the lobby. And I said, “Mike, I’ve got this edibles project. And maybe it’s something that would be up your alley.” I was very kind of low key about it. And he said, “Listen, I’ve got a secret. I’m now taking edibles for my sciatica.

Goa on India's western coast was freed from Portuguese rule on 19 December 1961, more than four centuries after it was colonised.

The fight for freedom began in the 1940s as India inched closer to independence from British rule. But Goa remained a Portuguese colony until 1961, straining relations between India and Portugal as the former's support for the anti-colonial movement in Goa grew. In 1955, India even imposed an economic blockade on Goa.

In 1961, the Indian army invaded the state after the Portuguese fired at Indian fishing boats, killing one fisherman.

After 36 hours of air, sea and land strikes by the army, General Manuel Antonio Vassalo e Silva, governor general of Goa, signed the ""instrument of surrender"", handing over Goan territory to India.

This is one of those recurrent topics and I receive email asking about this very often.Where will I fare better? What’s the safest place to be in as everything goes down?Those of you that have been reading my blog for a while know where I stand. I don’t think an isolated homestead or farm is the best place to be in, and it certainly isn’t when crime becomes a real problem all across the country. In people’s minds, in their novels and fantasies thing may always work out just the way they want. It also helps that none of the things speculated in these fictional scenarios have ever occurred, at least not yet. A person can be so easily fooled into thinking that his retreat or homestead in any given US state is safe from looters and criminals because this or that “expert” claims so, the real reason why it´s been working well for any given period of time is that you’ve never actually had it put to test by your environment.

98,0,27538,0,"Brain scans have revealed the workings of the brain's GPS that underpin our decisions as we navigate towards a destination.

Two areas of the brain appear to take turns as our internal global positioning system and work together to steer us through the environment. The brain regions take on different roles to meet our needs, with one keeping track of the distance to our destination as the crow flies, and the other chipping in to calculate the actual distance of the route ahead when we reach a junction.

Researchers pinpointed the neural systems by scanning volunteers' brains as they watched movies shot on the streets of Soho in central London.

""We have never known anything about how the brain represents information about future places we want to be,"" said Hugo Spiers, a neuroscientist at the Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience at University College London. They presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Washington.

""We didn't know if the brain tried to keep track of the straight line distance to the goal and we got there by minimising that distance, or whether the brain used the actual path we planned to take.""

To unravel how we navigate, Spiers and his colleague Lorelei Howard first gave volunteers maps of Soho to study and took them on an intensive two-hour tour of the area, during which they were asked to learn the streets and locations of 23 bars, shops and cafes. After the training session, they sat an exam to ensure they had learned the area well.

For the next stage of the experiment, the scientists had a film crew walk around Soho in the early hours of a summer morning to capture first-person footage of the routes between various streets and establishments.

The volunteers then laid in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner while they watched the movies on a screen in front of them. When the movie began, the name of the street they were on appeared alongside a picture of the bar or shop they had to get to.

During the experiment, the scientists paused the movie whenever a junction appeared and asked the volunteers which way to turn. What they did not know was that the movies were preset to follow the quickest route most of the time, and take them on detours at others.

""Once people made a decision on which way to turn, the movie carried on. But if they pressed left, the movie didn't always go left,"" Spiers said.

In some of the movies, the volunteers would find themselves geographically very close to their destination, but the road layout meant they still",526,11, faced a long walk to get to their goal. In
99,0,21741,0,"Jerusalem (CNN) Energized by American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the country's right-wing government has accelerated plans that imperil a two-state solution, solidifying Israel's power and control over Jerusalem.

In an all-night session, the Knesset, Israel's parliament, enacted a law early Tuesday making it much more difficult to negotiate Jerusalem as part of a peace process. The holy city is the most sensitive -- and perhaps most important -- issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with parts of the city claimed by both sides as their capital.

Only days earlier, a guiding body for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party voted unanimously to apply Israeli law to West Bank settlements. Although that vote was non-binding, such a move would be seen as Israeli annexation of the territory.

The law was passed as an amendment to Israel's Basic Law -- the closest thing Israel has to a constitution -- which gives it more political weight. The amendment stipulates that any attempt to transfer sovereign control of Jerusalem to a foreign entity needs to be approved by a supermajority of 80 Knesset members out of 120.

Previously, the requirement was a majority of 61 members.

And, in a move that is surely to be met with Palestinian outrage, the amendment also authorizes the Knesset to change the municipal borders of Jerusalem with a simple majority, provided any neighborhoods removed from the city remain under Israeli sovereignty. That allows Israel to remove Palestinian neighborhoods from the city per the Greater Jerusalem Plan being advanced by members of Netanyahu's governing coalition.

""The goal is one that is shared by the overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis,"" Deputy Minister Michael Oren told CNN,"" that Jerusalem will remain our capital and a Jewish majority city.""

In response to the new law, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said it was a ""declaration of war"" against the Palestinian people and their identity.

""This vote clearly indicates that Israel has officially declared the end of the so-called political process and has already begun to impose dictating and de facto policies,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.

""There is no legitimacy to the Trump decision, and there is no legitimacy to all the decisions of the Israeli Knesset. We will not allow in any way to allow such plans that are dangerous for the future of the region and the world to pass.""

Advancing the plan would also fuel unrest in a city and a region that has seen regular demonstrations since Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in early December.

The new law has little practical effect, says Daniel Siedemann, director of Terrestrial Jerusalem, a left-wing NGO that tracks developments in the holy city, but ""it does however incrementally add to the despair on the Palestinian side in the absence of any prospect of forward movement [toward a final-status agreement].""

""This is an unabashed attempt to shackle future Israeli majorities, and it fits into a whole range of actions that are currently taking place that are geared to make any future permanent status agreement based on the two-state solution impossible. This is a strategic thrust in that direction.""

Praising the amendment's passage, Education Minister Naftali Bennett said, ""Our understanding is clear: No Jew has the authority to give up any part of the land. Nor does the Jewish people",707,11,".""

The path in (b) is unique for the antiferromagnetic case and has low energy but also low multiplicity. \[Fig:levelscheme\]](fig_1.eps){width="".47\textwidth""}

We proceed with a strong coupling expansion to identify the magnetic coupling along the chain. This amounts to determine the difference in energy, between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, to fourth order in the hopping, since this is the leading order to the magnetic interaction between the high spin Co ions. As explained above we only have to take into account the $3z^2$-$r^2$ level on Co2 and the $t_{2g}$ levels on Co1. In an ionic picture all $t_{2g}$ levels on Co1 are filled while the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ level on Co2 is half-filled and we therefore consider hopping processes from the former to the latter. In the ferromagnetic configuration we include processes where two down spin electrons hop from Co1 to both neighboring Co2 and back again as displayed in Fig. \[Fig:levelscheme\]a.

Last week, the replication crisis in psychology was pushed back into the news when Susan Fiske, a former president of the Association for Psychological Science, wrote a column in which she criticized “online vigilantes” on blogs, Twitter, and Facebook who have taken prominent work in social psychology to task. Fiske likened these “destructo-critics” to “methodological terrorists.” This broadside was controversial, with myself and others responding that, when it comes to pointing out errors in published work, social media has been necessary. There just has been no reasonable alternative.

A couple days later, the other shoe dropped, as Dana Carney, one of the authors of a famous study proposing that power stances could translate into powerful feelings, disclaimed that work, which she had done in collaboration with Andy Yap and Amy Cuddy, a former student of Fiske. (I wrote about the power-pose study, which was conducted in 2010 but failed to replicate in 2014, earlier this year for Slate.) In a statement, which she posted on her website, Carney wrote, “The evidence against the existence of power poses is undeniable. … I do not think the effect is real.”

This note from Carney was wonderful news. I think it’s a great step forward when people are willing to reconsider their published research in light of methodological and empirical criticism.

The criticisms are valid. Researchers study small effects with noisy measurements and then look through their data to find statistically significant comparisons. This approach will be expected to lead to unreplicable claims. But, worse than that, it can lead to research communities where unreplicable results seem to reinforce each other: Study a small effect with noisy measurements, and any statistically significant claim will necessarily massively overestimate any underlying effects. In follow-up studies, researchers will then expect to see comparably huge effects, hence they anticipate “high power” (in statistics jargon), and they expect high rates of success. Coming into their studies with this expectation, they can feel justified in j",452,11,iggling their data until they get the findings they want

At 10 min before the end of incubation, PI was added to this cell suspension in order to stain necrotic cells, according to the manufacturer\'s instructions (BioVision, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). The cells were analyzed with a FACSCAN flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and the stained cells in the FL1-H and FL2-H channels were analyzed.

2.10. Cell Cycle Detection {#sec2.10}
--------------------------

The H9c2 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were harvested and seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS at a density of 2 × 10^6^ cells per flask. After allowing the cells to adhere, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium containing STS or control, and the cells were cultured for 24 h before radiation. After X-ray radiation at different doses, the cells were cultured for 24 h, harvested, washed once with cold PBS, resuspended in 1 mL of PBS, and then fixed with 2 mL of dehydrated ethanol for 30 min. The cells were collected, washed once with PBS, and then stained with 50 g/mL PI at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter XL, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) to determine the cell cycle distribution.

2.11. Western Blotting Analysis {#sec2.11}
-------------------------------

After treatment with STS or control, the cells at 80% confluence were collected and washed three times with PBS. Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer was added to extract the total protein. Equal amounts of protein from the samples and controls were loaded onto 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels for protein separation. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk for 3 h. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (p38 at 1 : 1000, p-p38 at 1 : 1000, Bcl-2 at 1 : 1000, Bax at 1 : 1000, and cleaved caspase 3 or caspase-3 at 1 : 1000) overnight at 4°C. After being washed with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1.5 h. Finally, the membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent to detect the proteins of interest. The levels of GADPH were used as loading controls.

2.12. Statistical Analysis {#sec2.12}
--------------------------

Statistical analyses of the results from the present study were performed using SPSS17.0 (version 12.0; IBM, USA). The results were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between the various levels of radiation with or without STS treatment were conducted by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); a paired *t*-test was used to evaluate differences between the same",779,11, levels of radiation versus without treatment; comparisons between groups were

Sepsis is a major health challenge. Despite improved treatment options, sepsis remains a leading cause of death in intensive care units \[[@B1]\]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, the major outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inflammatory response stimulator \[[@B2]\]. In addition, LPS triggers inflammation in gram-negative sepsis \[[@B3]\]. Excessive amounts of gut-derived LPS released during intestinal hypo-perfusion have also been implicated in sepsis caused by gram-positive and fungal infections \[[@B4],[@B5]\]. LPS signaling is initiated by the activation of the myeloid differentiation factor 2 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complexes on myeloid cells \[[@B2],[@B6]\]. TLR4 has recently been shown to recognize endogenous danger-type, or 'alarmin,' factors, thereby implicating TLR4 as a tissue injury and microbial invasion sensor \[[@B7]\]. Studies using mouse strains deficient in TLR4 signaling \[[@B8],[@B9]\] or expression \[[@B10]-[@B13]\] or those using TLR inhibitors in wild-type mice \[[@B14],[@B15]\] confirmed that TLR4 contributes to bacterial clearance and the host inflammatory response in the infection setting \[[@B16]\].

Two missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the *TLR4* gene, Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile, have been reported to be associated with endotoxin hypo-responsiveness to inhaled LPS \[[@B17]\]. This investigation was followed by a series of studies that explored the potential impact of these SNPs on the incidence and course of infectious diseases \[[@B18]\], such as septic shock with gram-negative bacterial infection \[[@B19]\]. Although some studies have shown a relevance of the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile SNPs in gram-negative infections, others did not confirm this association \[[@B20]-[@B22]\]. Furthermore, recent studies using primary cells isolated from individuals bearing these mutations have indicated that the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile haplotype has little or no effect on LPS responsiveness \[[@B23]\].

Recently, Sato et al. demonstrated the biological significance of a genetic variation of the *TLR4* gene called rs11536889. Functional analyses revealed that *TLR4* rs11536889 contributes to the translational regulation of TLR4 expression and has some influence on the response to LPS, possibly by binding to microRNAs, which act in post-transcriptional regulation \[[@B24]\]. A large study that included prostate cancer patients and age-matched controls from Sweden revealed an association between *TLR4* rs11536889 and prostate cancer \[[@B25]\]. Later, Hishida et al. observed that *TLR4* rs11536889 genotypes are associated with severe gastric atrophy in *helicobacter pylori*-seropositive Japanese subjects \[[@B26]\]. Zhou et al. found that the *TLR4* rs11536889 SNP is significantly associated with *hepatitis type B* virus recurrence after liver transplantation \[[@B27]\]. In addition, Miedema et al. found that this SNP is associated with an increased risk of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia \[[@B28]\]. These observations suggest that the rs11536889 genetic variation of the TLR4 gene may influence human inflammatory and/or malignant diseases \[[@B24]\].

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignancy of the kidneys, with clear cell (ccRCC) subtype identified in 85% of these cases; one-third of these patients experience synchronous metastatic disease and 20--30% of the remaining patients have metachronous metastatic RCC \[[@b1-amjcaserep-19-1354],[@b2-amjcaserep-19-1354]\]. Tibia is a very rare site of RCC metastasis: Zekri et al. \[[@b3-amjcaserep-19-1354]\] in a recent study of 103 patients with advanced RCC and metastatic bone disease reported that the pelvis and ribs were involved in 48% of the patients, followed by the spine in 42%, followed by the long bones and skull. Fottner et al. \[[@b4-amjcaserep-19-1354]\] described only 3 cases of tibial metastasis in 101 cases (2.97%) with RCC and found that patients with solitary types, age \<65 years old, absence of pathologic fracture, and tumor-free resection margins had a better survival rate compared to patients with multiple metastases. Patients with solitary bone metastasis from RCC have the best prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate between 35% and 60% \[[@b5-amjcaserep-19-1354]\].

111,0,26672,0,"The world has gone wild for Disney’s animated film Frozen, and one of the best ways to experience that Frozen fever right in your own home is through some movie-inspired snacking. There are countless ideas for marvelous Frozen-style treats online, so we’ve sifted through them and settled on a few of the ones we think Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Sven, and the rest would love most.

Whether you’re throwing a Frozen party or just want to munch on some Disney-themed snacks, these 12 options will delight friends, family, and Frozen fans of all ages.

1. These White Chocolate Banana Cake Snowballs from Nibbles and Feasts perfectly capture the film’s sweet character. The treat consists of freshly baked, buttery banana cake smothered in melted white chocolate and sprinkled with sweet, light coconut “snow” flakes.

2. Nobody who’s watched Frozen can get enough of the movie’s lovably comical snowman, Olaf. Now, you can serve up Olaf-inspired snacks in your own home with Bubbly Nature Creations’s Olaf Snowman Donuts. “The hardest part is making the heads which I suggest making a day or two ahead of time,” she notes. Store the heads in an airtight container until you use them, and delight in these adorable creations with friends and family.

3. Life Made Simple Bakes calls these Popcorn Snowballs “crunchy, gooey and sweet — perfect for any occasion!” The flavors of the snack are enhanced with the addition of a bit of vanilla extract and salt, resulting in a wonderful sweet-and-salty treat that everyone will adore. Whether you’re serving them at a Frozen-themed party, handing them out during the holidays, or simply enjoying a batch on your own as you sit down to view the film for a hundredth time, these snowballs will disappear in no time — and not because they’ve melted.

4. You’ll be greeted by dazzling splashes of color as you cut into Baked By Rachel’s Frozen-Inspired Surprise Watercolor Layer Cake. The blue, purple, and frosty white interior layers are reminiscent of the film’s chilly color palette, while the buttercream-frosted exterior is decked out with vibrant blue and purple sprinkles.

5. These Snowflake Sugar Cookies from Cake and Allie are just the perfect accoutrement to your Frozen-themed fun — and nearly too pretty to eat (though we don’t think that’ll be a problem)! The recipe takes a steady hand but it’s well worth the effort, resulting in buttery cookies in a gorgeous snowflake design, all topped with cool blue royal icing.

6. These Frosty White-Chocolate Dipped Oreos from Up Country Olio offer up blissful bites of indulgence. The chocolate dip is dyed to a beautiful light blue then ornamented with a snowflake transfer design (think of it as a temporary tattoo for your food) for a final touch.

7.“These little delicate snowflakes look like something Elsa would approve of,” writes The Chic Site. Her Frosted Vanilla Snowflake Cupcakes consist of a delicate, moist vanilla base and a blue-tinted vanilla cream cheese icing. Top them off with snowflake sprinkles inspired by the wintry kingdom of Arendelle. The recipe yields 12 cupcakes.

8. You’ve got to see these Disney-inspired Icy Blue Dessert Trifles for yourself. “Don’t the colors remind you so much of Elsa?” asks Mom Endeavors. These beautiful and frosty creations are the result of 4 easy ingredients: blue Jell-O (or other gelatin product), blueberry marshmallows, whipped cream, and blue and white nonparael candy balls, which can",837,11, typically be found in the baking section of your grocery store
112,0,20278,1025,".P. 36 the requests were automatically admitted.   Based on this determination, the district court granted the Agacinskis a partial summary judgment and held that (1) Zamborowski negligently handled the Agacinskis' state court litigation;  and (2) Zamborowski's negligence proximately caused the Agacinskis' injuries.   Because the district court granted summary judgment on the liability issue, the court concluded the only issue remaining for trial was the issue of damages.   Subsequently, the issues for trial were further narrowed when, just prior to the damages trial, Zamborowski agreed to settle the damages related to the lien placed on the Agacinskis' home.


7
At the damages trial, Stanley Agacinski testified that the Agacinskis never received from the Collinses the one-half ownership interest in the trucking equipment in exchange for the Agacinskis' boat.   He also testified that while he was working for the Collinses, they had underpaid him by approximately $12,000.   Finally, Stanley Agacinski admitted, in effect, that (1) the Agacinskis' damages were tied to the question of whether the Agacinskis owed money to the Collinses, or vice versa;  and (2) it was totally speculative as to which party owed the other party money.


8
At the conclusion of the Agacinskis' case, Zamborowski moved for, and received, a directed verdict on the damages issue.   In granting the directed verdict, the district court stated from the bench:


9
Mr. Agacinski in his testimony which the Court had reread to it in chambers by the court reporter said that he did not know whether the joint venture with the Collinses experienced a profit or a loss.   Plaintiffs have introduced no other evidence to show that the joint venture made a profit and the Court believes it would be speculative to permit the jury to presume that the joint venture made a profit.


10
Moreover, the court will say all of the damages claimed by the plaintiff in this Court's opinion are damages resulting from the breach of the contract which created the joint venture....


11
The Court now therefore grants a directed verdict on the remaining portion of the claim in favor of the defendant because the Court feels the plaintiffs have failed in their proofs.


12
On June 19, 1991, the district court entered an order granting Zamborowski's motion for a directed verdict.


13
On appeal, the Agacinskis assert that the district court erred in granting Zamborowski a directed verdict on the damages issue.2  They assert that even though the profits and losses associated with the trucking business were speculative, there was nothing speculative about the value of the boat they lost in the default judgment or about the $12,000 that the Collinses withheld from Stanley Agacinski's wages.


14
Initially, we note that in analyzing the motion for a directed verdict the district court stated that federal law, not Michigan law, provided the standard for a directed verdict.   The district court also stated that the federal standard for a directed verdict was the same as the Michigan standard.   The district court, however, was incorrect in its assertion that federal law provided the standard for a directed verdict in the case before the court.   A federal court exercising its diversity jurisdiction, such as in this case, applies the standard for a directed verdict used by the courts of the state whose substantive law governs.   Arms v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 731 F.2d 1245, 1248 (6th Cir.1984).   Because Michigan law provides the substantive law in this case, we apply the Michigan standard for directed verdicts.   In deciding whether or not to grant a motion for a directed verdict, a Michigan court must accord to the non-moving party the benefit of viewing the testimony and all legitimate inferences that may be drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.   If the evidence, when viewed in this manner, establishes a prima facie case, then the court must deny the motion for a directed verdict.   Beard v. Detroit, 404 N.W.2d 770, 774 (Mich.App.)  ( quoting Caldwell v. Fox, 394 Mich. 401 (1975)), appeal denied, 428 Mich. 901 (1987);   Thomas v.

Ten more New Jersey businesses are accused of price gouging after Superstorm Sandy, as state officials vow to continue to crack down on retailers who attempt to capitalize on victims' misfortune.

Attorney General Jeff Chiesa (Stacy Proebstle, Townsquare Media)

Its the second round of price gouging lawsuits. Ten more businesses, including seven hotels and three gas stations are accused of illegally overcharging consumers during the storm with excessively increased rates, according to the state Attorney General's office.

""We are talking about rates that went from 151%, 92% increased and that is just inexplicable to me and to the families that were victims of this natural disaster,"" said state Attorney General Jeff Chiesa.

The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and its control method that are preferable to be used when an input and output line (IO line) and the like, which output data and the like, are commonly used between banks.
2. Description of Related Art
In a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) having a plurality of banks, there are some cases in that a main input and output line (hereinbelow referred to as a MIO line), which inputs and outputs data from a memory cell to a peripheral circuit, is provided to each bank. The bank includes an address decoder, the memory cell array, a sense amplifier, and the like, and corresponds to a unit that is independently controlled in response to a command input from the external thereof. In addition, a plurality of local input and output lines (hereinbelow referred to as LIO lines), which inputs and outputs data to each memory cell via the sense amplifier and a bit line, connects with the MIO line.
In DRAM having a lot of MIO lines, if each bank is provided with the MIO line, the total number of the IO lines in a chip considerably increases, and the circuit line highly affects chip layout and space in DRAM that has a small storage capacity. In order to reduce the number of the MIO lines, the MIO line, which is provided with each bank, is commonly used between the banks. In this manner, a control of a bank unit is applied to a transistor and the like, which output data to the MIO line, and hence, a reduction in the number of the MIO lines is attempted.
On the other hand, in order to reduce testing cost, there are a lot of cases in that DRAM includes a circuit which achieves a parallel test (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication, No. 2000-40397). In the parallel test, a lot of data are simultaneously written to a plurality of the memory cells from the limited MIO line, and then, the data is simultaneously read and compared with each other. Thereby, it can be simultaneously determined that a plurality of the memory cells correctly operates when the data is compared and agrees with each other. It can be said that the parallel test is an indispensable technology to DRAM at present.
There are a lot of technologies in which a parallel number of the parallel test is increased by simultaneously activating a plurality or all of the banks. However, in the above-mentioned circuit in which the same MIO line is commonly used by a plurality of the banks, the same MIO line is connected with a plurality of the banks. For this reason, a conflict of data output from each bank takes place in the same MIO line commonly used by a plurality of the banks, when a plurality of the banks are simultaneously activated so as to input and output data in the parallel test. Therefore, a control method is necessary to avoid the conflict of data in the parallel test of the chip in which the same MIO line is commonly used by a plurality of the banks. That is, for example, as shown in FIG. 7 to FIG. 9, each bank has to be operated in serial at a stage, in which data is output to an external data input and output line DQ after all the banks are simultaneously activated so as to input the data. When this serial operation is employed, testing time increases rather than the case operating in parallel entirely, so that the testing cost increases.
FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 show a typical example of a semiconductor memory device that includes 4 banks. More particularly, FIG. 7 shows a connecting condition of a normal operation mode, while FIG. 8 shows a connecting condition of a parallel test mode. FIG. 9 shows a timing chart of a read operation in the parallel test mode.
As shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, 4 pieces of banks, or a bank 0 to a bank 3, which include a memory cell array and the like, are commonly provided with the 4 MIO lines. Each of the bank 0 to the bank 3 is provided with a bank array which includes",854,11, a plurality of the LIO lines (unillust

Is very difficult to understand the differences between bronchitis and pneumonia. Both are diseases of the lower respiratory system and have an equally adverse effect on pulmonary air passages. Proper knowledge about the difference between pneumonia and bronchitis facilitates correct diagnosis, a factor that is of utmost importance in the effective management and treatment of respiratory disorders.

The condition is due to viral infection, polluted conditions, or heavy smoking, it is of no use taking antibiotics because they can do nothing to eliminate irritants or viruses. Antibiotics are useful only in case of bacterial infection. Having a penchant for Acute Bronchitis led us to write all that there has been written on Acute Bronchitis here. Hope you too develop a penchant for Acute Bronchitis!

Opportunistic pneumonia: As long as your immune system is in good condition, you don't have to worry about contracting this disease.

However, people with weak immune systems should take special care not to get infected.

Don't be surprised if you find anything unusual here about Bronchitis Pneumonia.

There has been some interesting and unusual things here worth reading.

Causes and Treatment of Bronchitis

Around ninety percent of the people contract acute bronchitis due to viral infection. Many cases are also caused due to bacterial infection. If you contract acute bronchitis many times, you might contract chronic bronchitis sooner or later. Infection need not always be the cause for acute bronchitis. If you live in a dirty, polluted area or if you a heavy smoker, you stand a greater risk of contracting chronic bronchitis. There has been an uncalculatable amount of information added in this composition on Bronchitis Treatment. Don't try counting it!

Certain viruses such as SARS (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome) virus, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, influenza viruses, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), and HPV (human parainfluenza virus) also cause pneumonia. We would like you to leisurely go through this article on Types Bronchitis to get the real impact of the article. Types Bronchitis is a topic that has to be read clearly to devry university.

Gram negative bacteria causes certain cases of community-acquired pneumonia. It also attacks people suffering from chronic lung disorders and children suffering from cystic fibrosis. There is a lot of jargon connected with Bronchitis Doctor. However, we have eliminated the difficult ones, and only used the ones understood by everyone.

Regional and occupational pneumonia: For example, exposure to chemicals or cattle can cause this condition.

123,0,27173,0,"Sodium bisulfate

Sodium bisulfate, also known as sodium hydrogen sulfate, is the sodium salt of the bisulfate anion, with the molecular formula NaHSO4. Sodium bisulfate is an acid salt formed by partial neutralization of sulfuric acid by an equivalent of sodium base, typically in the form of either sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium chloride (table salt). It is a dry granular product that can be safely shipped and stored. The anhydrous form is hygroscopic. Solutions of sodium bisulfate are acidic, with a 1M solution having a pH of around 1.

Production
Sodium bisulfate is produced as an intermediate in the Mannheim process, an industrial process involving the reaction of sodium chloride and sulfuric acid:
NaCl  +  H2SO4   →  HCl  +  NaHSO4
This step is highly exothermic. The liquid sodium bisulfate is sprayed and cooled so that it forms a solid bead. The hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in water to produce hydrochloric acid as a useful coproduct of the reaction.

Although not of commercial interest, sodium bisulfate can be generated as a byproduct of the production of many other mineral acids via the reaction of their sodium salts with an excess of sulfuric acid:
NaX + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 +  HX ( X− = CN−, NO3−, ClO4−)
The acids HX produced have a lower boiling point than the reactants and are separated from the reaction mixture by distillation.

Chemical reactions
Hydrated sodium bisulfate dehydrates at  at which point it separates from the water molecule attached to it. Once cooled again, it is freshly hygroscopic. Heating sodium bisulfate to  produces sodium pyrosulfate, another colorless salt:
2 NaHSO4   →  Na2S2O7 +  H2O

Uses
Sodium bisulfate is used primarily to lower pH. it also is used in metal finishing, cleaning products, and to lower the pH of water for effective chlorination in swimming pools and hot tubs. Sodium bisulfate is also AAFCO approved as a general-use feed additive, including companion animal food. It is used as a urine acidifier to reduce urinary stones in cats.

You could ask five residents what Silver Spring’s boundaries are and receive five different answers, ranging from a neighborhood near the DC line to a city the size of the District of Columbia itself. But how did it end up this way to begin with? The answer involves a railroad, zip codes, and possibly Marion Barry.

Unlike northeastern states where every square inch of land sits inside a municipality, or western states where cities compete for territory to access natural resources or tax revenue, much of Maryland and Virginia are unincorporated. Part of the reason is that counties in these states can perform functions like zoning and schools, reducing the incentive for communities to become a town or city.

Silver Spring is one those places. As a result, most definitions of Silver Spring fall into two camps: one I call “Little Silver Spring,” or areas near its historical center, or “Big Silver Spring,” which comprises most of eastern Montgomery County.

Big Silver Spring

Francis Preston Blair founded Silver Spring in 1840 when he fell off his horse and discovered a mica-flecked spring. It became one of several towns that grew up around the Metropolitan Branch railroad, which starts in DC and heads northwest. Meanwhile, the rest of eastern Montgomery County remained largely undeveloped save for a few suburban developments and small villages with names like White Oak, Colesville, and Norwood.

Silver Spring became the reference point for the larger area, and “Big Silver Spring” was born. In the 1930s, home builder R.E. Latimer boasted that his new subdivision Burnt Mills Hills was three miles “beyond the Silver Spring traffic light” at Georgia Avenue and Colesville Road. Ken Lubel, owner of Tires of Silver Spring and a longtime resident, notes that Silver Spring addresses once appeared as far north as Columbia.

“Big Silver Spring,” or the Postal Service’s definition of Silver Spring. Image by Christy Batta.

The invention of zip codes in the 1960s made Big Silver Spring official right as suburbanization took hold. The first three digits of each five-digit zip code referred to a larger region.

Naturally, Silver Spring got its own prefix, “209,” and with it the rest of eastern Montgomery County. (This may have been due to then-DC mayor Marion Barry demanding that Silver Spring and Takoma Park give up the DC zip codes they were originally assigned.) New residents thus identified with Silver Spring and participated in activities there, like these students at then-new Springbrook High School marching in the 1970 Silver Spring Thanksgiving parade.

The US Postal Service assigns Silver Spring addresses to all of zip codes 20901, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 10, and parts of 20912, which is mostly in the city of Takoma Park. This definition stretches from the District line to the Patuxent River to the north, and roughly from Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue to the west to Prince George’s County to the east, and even dipping into Prince George’s in a few places. At its widest point, Big Silver Spring is about 12 miles",691,11," long.

Puerto Rico's government says 3,600 pounds (1,633 kilograms) worth of donated supplies are en route to Venezuela as part of a humanitarian aid mission.

Officials said earlier Thursday that they had sent the supplies to the South American country.

Puerto Rico Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marin said in an updated statement that a plane carrying the supplies left the U.S. territory on Wednesday but has not yet delivered them.

It is unclear where the plane and supplies are currently located. Rivera said: ""(It's) an extremely complex route that is being protected to ensure the safety of those transporting the supplies as well as those receiving them.""

Officials have said the humanitarian aid is not part of the $20 million in aid pledged by the United States.

Venezuelan community leader Sonia Cosme told The Associated Press that the supplies including medication to help treat diabetes, blood pressure, asthma and seizures. There also are items for children including diapers, formula, milk, oral serums and protein drinks.

FULL STORY

New research at North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine indicates that cloned pigs can have the same degree of variability in physical appearance and behavior as normally bred animals. Two separate studies show that while clones are genetically identical to the original animal, the similarities end there.

This dispels the commonly held notion that cloned animals retain the physical and behavioral attributes of the animal from which they were cloned. The research was conducted by Dr. Jorge

Piedrahita, professor of molecular biomedical sciences at NC State, and colleagues at Texas A&M University. His study on cloned pig behavior, which appears in Applied Animal Behaviour Science, is the first published research on the behavior of cloned mammals. The study on cloned pig physiology, which appears in Biology of Reproduction, is the first study on clone physiology that included control subjects.

Piedrahita says the implications are far-reaching. ""The technology of cloning has been sold to the public as a way of creating a group of identical animals and, as such, there are companies that have been set up around this concept, especially for pet cloning. The implication",341,11, is that your cloned pet is going to behave and

131,0,20357,0,"Last night, Facebook put the final wheels in motion for a plan it’s been unfurling since last year — a plan to remove a remaining few’s ability to make themselves unsearchable on Facebook.

That sounds insidious, and on some level it is insidious. Facebook serves many masters, and some of the choices it makes on our behalf don’t align with our interests, which may from time to time include darkening our Facebook accounts without permanently deleting them.

Before we delve into that, let’s review what’s happening: Last December, Facebook removed a privacy setting called “Who can look up your Timeline by name?” for people who weren’t using it. That was most of us, said Facebook. For the “small percentage” who did use it, Facebook left their accounts untouched — until yesterday, when the company announced plans to sunset the feature, noting users would “see reminders about it being removed in the coming weeks.”

By blocking search access to your Timeline, you were extricating yourself from Facebook’s de facto search engine. If someone typed your name into Facebook’s search box, you wouldn’t appear in the results. It was a way to isolate yourself from drive-by searches, preventing non-friends from noticing your presence on Facebook. It was, in so many words, a little like opting out of the phone book.

But Facebook is no phone book, and the feature was never a blanket profile discovery block. People could still find you indirectly, and were even likely to if they happened to be friends of friends, say they poked through a mutual friend’s friend list or noticed you tagged in a photo.

Those are some of the reasons users in the know considered the feature broken. Facebook offers a few more here:

The setting also made Facebook’s search feature feel broken at times. For example, people told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn’t find them in search results, or when two people were in a Facebook Group and then couldn’t find each other through search.

Fair enough, but what some people complain is confusing, the person who’s opted not to be searchable probably calls “a feature that works.” And if two people in a Facebook Group can’t find each other through search, why can’t they link up through the Facebook Group? Isn’t the point of making yourself unsearchable, you know, to make yourself unsearchable?

But yes, as noted, Facebook’s unsearch option as implemented was disingenuous, and people who thought it amounted to a one-click opt-out simply misunderstood it. There is no one-click unsearch option in Facebook, unless we’re counting “Deactivate your account,” though even there, as Facebook says, “Some information may still be visible to others, such as your name in [a friend’s] friends list and messages you sent.” By removing unsearch, Facebook’s doing that remaining “small percentage” a favor by disabusing them of any sense they might have had that extricating themselves from Facebook search was in fact extricating them from Facebook search.

What happens now? We’re left with no net at all (however threadbare, inelastic and the opposite of impervious the net was). And that brings us to the real privacy problem: that Facebook has no blanket opt-out setting.

Today, if you want to prevent people from accessing your information, you can, but on a person by person basis. If you’re being stalked or harassed, you can blacklist the perpetrator, but on a case-by-case basis. That works when you know who the perpetrator is, but probably accounts for mostly dim-bulb stalkers or bullies unacquainted with the concept of anonymity. The brighter, more determined bulbs just circle back to snoop on or bother people vis-a-vis alternate accounts. By not giving users a blanket unsearch option (that is, letting us remove ourselves from all forms of search, even temporarily), Facebook’s making it easier than ever for stalkers, bullies and passive-aggressive jerks to keep",915,11," doing what they do.

134,0,24595,3075," the loaded *Q* of the resonator devices with *w~i~* = 1.0, 1.6, and 2.2 *μ*m were approximately 4,300, 8,000, and 9,300, respectively, indicating closeness to critical coupling for the larger intrinsic region widths and the effect of free-carrier absorption for the device with lowest *w~i~*.

Dark current in the *w~i~* = 1.6 *μ*m structure is below 500 pA at reverse biases up to 30 V (as shown in [Fig. 3(b)](#f3){ref-type=""fig""}), with large separation from the photocurrent when illuminated on resonance (near 1538 nm in this device) over a large voltage range. Photocurrent spectra obtained at a reverse bias of 22 V for input powers between 1 and 100 *μ*W are plotted in [Fig. 3(c)](#f3){ref-type=""fig""}; the carrier photogeneration rate is proportional to stored cavity energy, and the spectra are thus Lorentzian at low input powers and exhibit bistability resulting from the thermo-optic effect[@b37] at higher powers. The peak current relates directly to the onresonance quantum efficiency (QE), plotted over a range of input powers and biases in [Fig. 3(d)](#f3){ref-type=""fig""}; QE here is defined as number of charge carriers extracted per photon incident on the cavity, calculated from *I*~pk~*hν*/*P*~in~*q*, where *I*~pk~ is the peak resonant photocurrent and *P*~in~ is the optical power input after the grating coupler. A strong voltage dependence is observed, and large voltages of at least 15 V are required to achieve QEs above 10%, likely due to inefficient extraction under low fields due to recombination in the 1.6 *μ*m-wide intrinsic region. The power dependence of the peak QE appears similar to that previously reported in resonant pSi photodetectors[@b31], and could be due to density-dependent recombination rates; this effect must be stronger than any contribution from two-photon absorption at the higher powers in the range of powers studied here, since no increase in QE at high optical powers is observed. We applied a maximum of 30 V bias to the device, and observed a peak QE of 28% (0.35 A/W). At voltages in this range, material properties of the pSi appear to have been affected in a way which resulted in permanent (stable at least for many days) changes in the device response; the data presented here was verified to be stable, and we briefly discuss some of the changes observed in the [Supplementary Information](#s1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}.

Geometry also strongly influenced the modulation response of the photodetectors. Devices with narrower intrinsic regions had significantly faster 3-dB bandwidths; a modulation response curve with an empirical fit is shown in [Fig. 4(a)](#f4){ref-type=""fig""} for a device with a 1 *μ*m-wide intrinsic region with -30 V applied (a DC QE of 25% and 30 nA dark current were measured in this device and bias), indicating a 2.9 GHz 3-dB roll-off. Oscillations around the fit are repeatable and due primarily to impedance mismatch between the device\'s large series resistance and the 50 Ω load. The measured bandwidth increases strongly with increasing reverse bias, and is lower in devices with larger intrinsic region widths (the three curves in [Fig. 4(b)](#f4){ref-",840,11,"type=""fig""}).

The transits have been observed using several telescopes mainly throughout the YETI network. In 25 cases, complete transit light curves with a timing precision better than $1.4\:$min have been obtained. These light curves have been used to refine the system properties, namely inclination $i$, planet-to-star radius ratio $R_\textrm{p}/R_\textrm{s}$, and the ratio between the semimajor axis and the stellar radius $a/R_\textrm{s}$. First analyses by @Hartman2011 suggest the existence of a second planet in the system, thus we tried to find an additional body using the transit timing variation (TTV) technique. Taking also literature data points into account, we can explain all mid-transit times by refining the linear ephemeris by [$21\:$ms]{}. Thus we can exclude TTV amplitudes of more than [$\sim1.5\:$min]{}.'

The 2019 European Parliament election in Italy were held on 26 May 2019, electing members of the 9th Italian delegation to the European Parliament as part of the European elections held across the European Union.

Electoral system 
The party-list proportional representation was the traditional electoral system of the Italian Republic from its establishment in 1946 to 1994, therefore it was also adopted to elect the Italian members of the European Parliament (MEPs) since 1979.

Two levels were introduced: a national level to divide the seats among parties and a constituency level to distribute them among candidates in open lists. Five constituencies were established, each including 2–5 regions and each electing a fixed number of MEPs. At national level, seats are divided between party lists using the largest remainder method with Hare quota. Seats are allocated to parties and then to their most voted candidates.

In the run-up to the 2009 European Parliament election, the Italian Parliament introduced a national threshold of 4%. An exception was granted for parties representing some linguistic minorities as such lists can be connected with one of the major parties, combining their votes, provided that those parties reach the 4% threshold and that candidates from minority parties obtain a sufficient number of votes, no less than 50,000 for the main candidate.

Background 
In 2014, the governing Democratic Party (PD) of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi won the election with 40.8% of the vote and 31 seats, followed by the Five Star Movement (M5S) with 21.2% and 17 seats and Forza Italia (FI) with 16.8% and 13 seats. As a result, the PD was the second largest national party in the European Parliament by number of seats after the German CDU/CSU and the largest among the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). The PD's score was also the best result for an Italian party in a nationwide election since the 1958 general election, when the Christian Democracy (DC) won 42.4% of the vote.

However, after less than three years from the 2014 electoral landslide, Renzi was forced to resign after the defeat in the constitutional referendum and his foreign affairs minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new head of government in December 2016. Moreover, the 2018 general election was characterized by a strong showing of populist parties. The centre-right coalition, led by Matteo Salvini's right-wing League, emerged with a plurality of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate while the anti-establishment M5S led by Luigi Di Maio became the party with the largest number of votes; and Renzi's centre-left came only third, with the worst electoral result of its history. However, no political group or party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament. After three months of negotiation, a government was finally formed on 1 June by the M5S and the League, with the M5S-linked independent Giuseppe Conte as Prime Minister and Di Maio and Salvini Deputy Prime Ministers.

In March 2019, Nicola Zingaretti was elected secretary of the PD. In April, Zingaretti presented a special logo for the election, including a large reference to ""We Are Europeans"", a manifesto launched by Carlo Calenda; and the symbol of the Party of European Socialists (PES). Additionally, the PD is trying to forge an alliance with the Article One (Art.1) and minor parties. March and April registered more developments on the centre-left side of the political spectrum.

Well, it's the defending NFC champions that are next on the schedule and they offer up a bevy of obstacles for the Cowboys to overcome. However, these aren't the same Seahawks that we've seen in back-to-back Super Bowls, they are having their own set of struggles that could favor the Cowboys and allow them to escape with a victory.

When The Cowboys Have The Ball

Offensively, the Cowboys are going to have some trouble moving the ball against this defense that is in the top of the league in many categories. The one positive for the Cowboys is that they seem to have found some rhythm in the running game and their offensive line has really improved with the addition of La'el Collins to the starting lineup. The Seattle defensive line is a very strong unit but they struggled against the Cowboys last season due to the physical nature of their offensive line. It's roughly the same lineup for Seattle defensively but the addition of Frank Clark has given the Seahawks the same luxury as the Cowboys have with Randy Gregory. The Cowboys will have to continue their stat-busting style of running. The Giants came into last week's contest as the seventh-best rushing defense, they walked away as the 21st ranked rushing defense.

For Dallas, they must get this running game going against the sixth-best rushing defense. Bryan Broaddus and others have expressed their belief in the offensive line being skilled enough to run against any opponent and with Dez Bryant back in the fold, that should bode well for their chances at success. Dallas' offensive line found their groove last week by running Darren McFadden and getting him help with",365,11, reverses. Bobby Wagner has been a very good player

This statistical interpretation (SI) of QT eliminates all mysteries and paradoxes - and this shows that the mysteries and paradoxes are not part of QT itself but rather the result of a particular (mis)interpretation of QT. In view of the similarity discussed above, we adopt the statistical point of view, not only for the interpretation of QT itself, but also in our search for *quantization conditions*. The general strategy is to find a new set of (as) simple (as possible) statistical assumptions which can be understood in physical terms and imply QT. Such an approach would also provide an explanation for the correspondence rules .

The present paper belongs to a series of works aimed at such an explanation.

    The web server works with any PHP application, not only Symfony projects,
    so it's a very useful generic development tool.

Setting up an Existing Symfony Project
--------------------------------------

In addition to creating new Symfony projects, you will also work on projects
already created by other developers. In that case, you only need to get the
project code and install the dependencies with Composer. Assuming your team uses
Git, setup your project with the following commands:

.. code-block:: terminal

    # clone the project to download its contents
    $ cd projects/
    $ git clone...

    # make Composer install the project's dependencies into vendor/
    $ cd my-project/
    $ composer install

You'll probably also need to customize your :ref:`.env file <config-dot-env>`
and do a few other project-specific tasks (e.g. creating a database). When
working on a existing Symfony application for the first time, it may be useful
to run this command which displays information about the project:

Installing Packages
-------------------

A common practice when developing Symfony applications is to install packages
(Symfony calls them :doc:`bundles </bundles>`) that provide ready-to-use
features. Packages usually require some setup before using them (editing some
file to enable the bundle, creating some file to add some initial config, etc.)

Most of the time this setup can be automated and that's why Symfony includes
`Symfony Flex`_, a tool to simplify the installation/removal of packages in
Symfony applications. Technically speaking, Symfony Flex is a Composer plugin
that is installed by default when creating a new Symfony application and which
**automates the most common tasks of Symfony applications**.

.. tip::

    You can also :doc:`add Symfony Flex to an existing project </setup/flex>`.

Symfony Flex modifies the behavior of the ``require``, ``update``, and
``remove`` Composer commands to provide advanced features. Consider the
following example:

**Photographic Glossary**

_In this section, many of the materials you will encounter while crafting beaded jewelry are listed alphabetically under these headings: Tools, Findings, Accessories, and Beads. Look to this section for detailed descriptions and photographs of materials._

**Tools**

**BEAD BOARDS**

Bead boards are flat and have graduated calibrated beading channels and recessed storage areas. Used to lay out and plan bead designs and organize beads and findings, most boards are flocked to prevent objects from rolling.

**BEADING NEEDLES**

Beading needles are available in flexible wire or stiff metal and used to guide beads onto a bead cord that does not come with an attached needle. Use collapsible eye needles with beads that have very small holes.

**BEAD REAMERS**

Bead reamers have long diamond grit covered tips, are used for enlarging and smoothing out holes in beads. Also available in a battery-operated version.

**JUMP RING TOOL**

Jump ring tool is a ring designed to fit over a finger with two different sized slots on top. Jump rings can be fitted into one of the slots and the tool is twisted to open and close the jump rings. Slots are different sizes to accommodate various sizes of jump rings.

**KNOTTING TOOL**

Knotting tool has a pin with a Y-shaped prong next to it and is used to form tight knots between beads strung on silk or nylon bead cord.

**PLIERS AND WIRE CUTTERS**

Pliers and wire cutters are each designed for a special purpose.

**Chain-nose pliers**, also known as flat nose pliers, have a fine nose with double half-round tips and are used to form loops and other configurations in wire, close bead tips, open and close jump rings, flatten crimps, and attach findings. The flat interior of the nose will not mar wire if used gently.

**Crimp pliers** are used to close and secure crimp beads and tubes. The inner position on the pliers forms a groove and the outer position rounds the crimp, making it smooth and comfortable. Pliers are available in different sizes to coordinate with different sizes of crimp tubes.

**Nylon-tipped, flat-jawed pliers** are used to help shape coated wire without marking the wire. They are also used to straighten wire before use by lightly pulling the wire through the pliers.

**Round-nose pliers**, tapered and slim with double-round tips, are used for looping and shaping wire into curves. Combination flat/round tipped pliers are also available for making sharp bends in wire, uniform loops, and jump rings.

**Split ring pliers** have one straight tip and one tip with a small hook on the end. They are used to separate split rings and keep them separated in order to attach other findings.

**Heavy-duty wire cutters** cut heavy wire gauges and steel wire such as memory wire. Memory wire can also be cut with memory wire she",761,11,"ars.

The sequences were aligned in ClustalW implemented in BioEdit 7.2.5 (ref. 66) and manually curated for correct local alignment.

Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenies were reconstructed for the concatenated mitochondrial genes and the concatenated RAD sequences separately, including both variant and invariant sites using a maximum likelihood approach (RAxML v. 7.7.7 and ExaML v. 1.0.4)67,68. For the mitochondrial dataset, a maximum likelihood tree was reconstructed using three partitions, one for Dloop, one for the first and the second codon positions of ND2, and one for the third codon position of ND2. For each dataset, we performed a RAxML analysis with 100 rapid bootstraps using the GTRGAMMA model of rate heterogeneity. For the RAD-seq dataset, we used all concatenated sites with no more than 40 individuals missing (25%) to reconstruct a maximum likelihood tree with RAxML (ref. 67) and ExaML (ref. 68). Each of 100 bootstraps was performed by randomly sampling with replacement sites from the concatenated dataset to get a dataset of the original size. The maximum likelihood tree was then inferred for each resampled dataset with ExaML (ref. 68) using a GTRGAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, as recommended in the RAxML-light manual68. We calculated bootstrap support values based on these 100 topologies with RAxML (ref. 67). The nuclear and mitochondrial trees were rooted with the reference genome of Oreochromis niloticus and ladderized and plotted using the R-package Ape v. 3.1 (ref. 69).

We then used RAD-derived SNP data to infer the species tree for the LVRS groups and their closest relatives with SNAPP (ref. 45). SNAPP bypasses gene trees and computes species trees directly from independently inherited markers by integrating over all possible gene trees45. We restricted this analysis to two individuals per species (one for A. sp. ‘Yaekama’) and as SNAPP assumes no linkage among loci, we included only biallelic sites that were at least 500 kb apart from each other. The resulting data set contained 31 individuals and 1,817 sites. We ran SNAPP for 1,000,000 iterations, sampling every 1,000th iteration using default priors. We discarded the first 50% of the trees as burn-in and visualized the posterior distribution of the remaining 500 trees as consensus trees in Densitree70.

Mitochondrial chronograms

Dated phylogenies were reconstructed based on mitochondrial D-loop65 and ND2 (ref. 64) sequences using BEAST v. 2.3.0 (ref. 71) and four different sets of calibration nodes (Supplementary Methods). We caution that the mitochondrial tree only shows the phylogeny of the maternal line and that time estimates more recent than one million years are most likely overestimates because of the increase of molecular rates towards the recent (Supplementary Methods).

To compare the splitting time between cichlid lineages with the major relevant geological events, we reconstructed paleogeographic maps at different time points based on previously published data and reviews (see Supplementary Methods).

Patterson’s D statistics

To test for evidence of ancient admixture among lineages, we computed Patterson’s D statistic46,72 (ABBA-BABA test), a method to detect admixture based on the frequencies of discordant SNP genealogies in a four-taxon tree, with the software package ADMIXTOOLS v. 1.1 (ref. 48). Genotypes were discarded if they had less than 6 reads or a genotype quality Phred score <20 (that is, error probability >1%). Significance of D statistics was assessed with a block jackknife procedure using a z score of three standard errors as a threshold48. We used three individuals of Astatotilapia flavijosephi from Lake Kinneret as the outgroup population and we tested for evidence of gene flow from each Eastern and Upper Nile clade into the LVRS relative to allele sharing with the closest relative of the LVRS, the Congo drainage taxa A. stappersi from",982,11, Zambia (Fig. 2) or A. sp

In this background primer, D&S Research Analyst Laura Reed and D&S Founder danah boyd situate the current debate around the role of technology in the public sphere within a historical context. They identify and tease out some of the underlying values, biases, and assumptions present in the current debate surrounding the relationship between media and democracy, and connect them to existing scholarship within media history that is working to understand the organizational, institutional, social, political, and economic factors affecting the flow of news and information. They also identify a set of key questions to keep in mind as the conversation around technology and the public sphere evolves.

Algorithms play an increasingly significant role in shaping the digital news and information landscape, and there is growing concern about the potential negative impact that algorithms might have on public discourse. Examples of algorithmic biases and increasingly curated news feeds call into question the degree to which individuals have equal access to the means of producing, disseminating, and accessing information online. At the same time, these debates about the relationship between media, democracy, and publics are not new, and linking those debates to these emerging conversations about algorithms can help clarify the underlying assumptions and expectations. What do we want algorithms to do in an era of personalization? What does a successful algorithm look like? What form does an ideal public sphere take in the digital age? In asking these and other questions, we seek to highlight what’s at stake in the conversation about algorithms and publics moving forward.

152,0,28125,2050," crystallites have one crystal plane parallel to the substrate, but no preferential orientation in the chip's plane. To obtain a significant electro-optic response for the quasi-TE optical mode, a poling step is performed by applying 60--80 V (≈150 kV cm^−1^) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by several hours of stabilization time.

The transmission spectrum is measured for different direct current (DC) voltages applied across the PZT layer (Fig. [1e](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}). The voltage-induced index change shifts the resonance. In Fig. [1f](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}, the resonance wavelength shift is plotted as a function of voltage, and the slope gives the tuning efficiency Δ*λ*/Δ*V* ≈ −13.4 pm V^−1^. From this, we estimate the half-wave voltage-length product to be *V*~*π*~*L* = \|*Lλ*~FSR~Δ*V*/(2Δ*λ*)\| ≈ 3.3 Vcm. Through simulation of the optical mode and DC electric field, the effective electro-optic coefficient *r*~eff~ of the PZT layer is estimated to be 61 pm V^−1^ (see Methods). Measurements on other modulator structures yield consistent values for *r*~eff~ (67 and 70 pm V^−1^ for, respectively, the C-band Mach--Zehnder and O-band ring), and the smallest *V*~*π*~*L* value (≈3.2 V cm) was measured on an O-band ring (Supplementary Note [1](#MOESM1){ref-type=""media""}).

The PZT was poled prior to the measurements, after which no bias voltage was used. To demonstrate longer term stability of the poling, the DC tuning efficiency was periodically measured (sweeping the voltage over \[−2, +2\] V) on a C-band ring over a total time of almost 3 days. In Fig. [2](#Fig2){ref-type=""fig""}, the absolute value of the resulting tuning efficiency Δ*λ*/Δ*V* is plotted as a function of time, decaying towards a stable value of about 13.5 pm V^−1^ over the course of several hours. The poling stabilized and there have been no indications of decay over much longer periods of time, hence modulation is possible without a constant bias, as opposed to similar materials like BTO^[@CR19]--[@CR21]^.Fig. 2Poling stability of the electro-optic film.

154,0,25552,0,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Unrwa provides critical services, including education and health care

The United States is ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, the US State Department says.

It described the organisation, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), as ""irredeemably flawed"".

The US administration has ""carefully reviewed"" the issue and ""will not make additional contributions to Unrwa,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later said the move was an ""assault"" against his people.

""Such a punishment will not succeed to change the fact that the United States no longer has a role in the region and that it is not a part of the solution,"" Nabil Abu Rudeina told Reuters news agency.

He added that the decision was ""a defiance of UN resolutions"".

A spokesman for Unrwa, Chris Gunness, defended the agency in a series of tweets.

""We reject in the strongest possible terms the criticism that Unrwa's schools, health centres, and emergency assistance programs are 'irredeemably flawed',"" he wrote.

The latest move comes after the US announced back in January that it would withhold more than half of a tranche of funding for the agency.

What is Unrwa?

Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

The agency says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services.

The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $364m (£283m) in 2017 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region.

The Trump administration had pledged $60m to Unrwa in January, but withheld another $65m.

The remaining payment of $65m is now expected to be cancelled.

Why is the US critical of Unrwa?

The US disagrees with Unrwa, and Palestinian officials, on a number of issues.

US President Donald Trump has previously complained that the US received ""no appreciation or respect"" for the large sums of aid it provided to the region.

Earlier this year, he threatened to cut aid to the Palestinians over what he called their unwillingness to negotiate with Israel.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The US has said Unrwa needs to become more accountable

The US and Israel also disagree with Unrwa on which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 war.

Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said earlier this week that Unrwa exaggerated the number of Palestinian refugees, and needed to reform.

""You're looking at the fact that, yes, there's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America,"" she said.

The state department says the US is contributing a ""very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs"".

It complains of a business model and fiscal practices, linked to an ""exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries"", which is ""unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years"".

What does the Palestinian side say?

On Friday, the Palestinian representative in Washington, Hossam Zomlot, accused the US of ""endorsing the most extreme Israeli narrative on all issues including the rights of more than five million Palestinian refugees"".

The US ""is damaging not only an already volatile situation but the prospects for future peace"", he told AFP.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Nikki Haley has criticised Palestinian officials for ""bashing America""

Palestinian officials have already accused the Trump administration of worsening tensions due to its pro-Israel stance.

In December, Mr Trump controversially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite it being claimed by both sides.

His move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue, attracted international criticism, and led to the Palestinian Authority cutting off dialogue in Washington.

In May, the US also opened an embassy in Jerusalem, a move described by Palestinian officials as a ""blatant provocation"".

What's the Israeli view?

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"".

However, he said that ""every step taken also contains some risk"".

Some Israelis have raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region.

Can I use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to clean brown stains off of above ground pool steps while they are in the pool? Will it affect the pool water?

Hi Amy. If you were to remove the steps from the pool you could use just about anything on them. Inside the pool you do, of course, need to be a little more careful.

You might try rubbing a chlorine tablet over the area and then scrubbing with a rag. Or possibly dousing a rag with liquid chlorine and scrubbing. Use rubber gloves of course, but the chlorine would not hurt the pool water. There are also certain tile scrubbers sold at pool stores that might work.

==========

With rapid advances in the field of sports medicine, many pathologies hitherto inaccessible to arthroscopic surgery have now been rendered to the realm of the arthroscopist. Rotator cuff tears have been seen in this purview ever since Wolf \[[@B1]-[@B4]\] did the first all arthroscopic repair. Many techniques have been enumerated \[[@B3],[@B5],[@B6],[@B8],[@B9]\] and they require a long learning curve and numerous expensive instruments. The objective in all methods is to have a stable suture-cuff and suture-bone interface that permits early and adequate rehabilitation which would hasten the recovery and return to work and sport. The commonly used methods in the U- or L-shaped tears employ either the 2-step or the 1-step techniques \[[@B1]\]. In the former, the sutures are passed through each cuff margin one at a time and in the latter, through both margins simultaneously. The first method requires specialized instrumentation and takes more time while the second may result in incomplete repair since it requires the margins to be properly aligned prior to repair. The need is to have a technique combining the advantages of both that would be technically easier, use less instruments and time and give good fixation. We have tried to address these issues in our technique. The advantages that our technique offers are:

1\. It is a simple, cost and time saving percutaneous technique using spinal needles employing the best possible site of insertion for a particular morphology of tear without using additional portals which may add to the operating time and morbidity.

2\. The needle can be inserted perpendicular to the tear margin which gives the best possible strength of the stitch to withstand tear-out and maintains reduction of the repair.

3\. Only commonly used spinal needles and suture material is employed in repair.

Method
======

We perform the procedure (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}, [2](#F2){ref-type=""fig""}) under general anesthesia in the lateral decubitus position. The lateral position is preferred because it provides a stable positioning of the patient and a pronounced glenohumeral and subacromial opening through traction on the upper limb. First, routine diagnostic arthroscopy using the standard anterior and posterior portals (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type=""fig""}) is performed to examine the glenohumeral joint and confirm the presence of a rotator cuff tear. We also employ the lateral portal as needed. The tear margins are debrided with a shaver and any other joint pathology is noted and addressed to, if possible. Once a tear is identified and considered appropriate for repair by this method, the arthroscope is introduced via the lateral portal and subacromial decompression",606,11, and acromioplasty are done.

About

What We Believe
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
We are Disciples of Christ, a movement for wholeness in a fragmented world. As part of the one body of Christ, we welcome all to the Lord’s Table as God has welcomed us. As members of the Christian Church, we confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and proclaim him Lord and Savior of the world.

Open CommunionThe Lord’s Supper, or Communion, is celebrated in weekly worship and is open to all.

Freedom of BeliefDisciples are free to follow their conscience guided by the Bible, the Holy Spirit, study and prayer, and are expected to extend that freedom to others.

BaptismIn baptism, the old self-centered life is set aside and a new life of trust in God begins. Although Disciples practice baptism by immersion, other baptism traditions are honored.

The Oneness of the ChurchAll Christians are called to be one in Christ and to seek opportunities for common witness and service.

The Ministry of BelieversBoth ministers and lay persons lead in worship, service and spiritual growth.

Our Staff

Reverend Bill Hemm – Senior Pastor
I was raised in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma and grew up at First Christian Church in Jenks. Being active in camps, conferences, retreats, and regional youth council, I found a love for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). I graduated from Broken Arrow High School in 1997 and moved to Fayetteville to attend the University of Arkansas where I graduated in 2001 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics. The calling to ministry was a slow process that eventually took hold of me. In January, 2007, I enrolled at Phillips Theological Seminary. I graduated in December, 2011, with my Masters of Divinity. In February, 2012, I was ordained at First Christian Church in Jenks, OK and I have been excited to be a part of the Forest Park Christian Church family of faith since 2012!

Diane McCrackin – SecretaryI am a lifelong Disciple and member of First Christian Church in Broken Arrow where I am active in many ministries. I began at Forest Park in 2016. Prior to serving in this role, I obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Gerontology from Oklahoma State University and",490,11, a Master’s Degree in Education from the University

Simulation
==========

We performed a batting simulation according to the results presented in the previous section. Figure \[fig5\](a) shows our simulation setup, in which a home plate was placed at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. The initial position of the center of mass of a baseball was set at ${\bf r}_{0} = ($18.44 m, 0 m, 1.8 m$)$ according to the official baseball rules in Japan and the average height of Japanese professional baseball players. The baseball was pitched in the negative direction of the $x$ axis with an initial velocity of ${\bm V}_{0} =  V_{0} \hat { {\bm C} }$, where $\hat { {\bm C} }$ is the unit direction vector of the pitch, which will be defined later. Here, $V_{0}$ is randomly chosen according to the distribution function given by Eq. (\[md\]) with the parameters shown in Table II.

![Schematics showing (a) our simulation setup and (b) the definition of $z^{'}_{b}$.[]{data-label=""fig5""}](fig5.eps){width=""12cm""}

The pitch direction was defined as follows. A ball needs to be thrown from about shoulder height and be launched in an almost horizontal direction to cross the plate at the correct height[@cross]. Thus, we assume that a pitcher throws a ball toward a point ${\bf P} = ($0, $P_{y}$ \[m\], 1.8 m$)$ that is on the $y$-$z$ plane. A thrown ball travels a curved path to cross the plate at a height less than the initial height due to the gravitational force (Fig. \[fig5\](b)). $P_{y}$ is the random variable selected by the distribution function $\psi(P_{y})$ defined in Eq. (\[md2\]). The unit vector of the pitch direction was defined as $\hat { {\bm C} } = {\bm C} / |{\bm C}|$, where ${\bm C} \equiv {\bf P} - {\bf r}_{0}$.

Modeling of Bat and Swing
-------------------------

We consider the bat to be an uniform cylinder 1 m long and the diameter of the base to be $6.6 \times 10^{-2}$ m, in accordance with the official baseball rules. The bat is placed along the $y$ axis, and its center of mass is positioned at $($0, 0, $z_{b}$ \[m\]$)$, where $z_{b}$ is defined later. For later discussions, we respectively label bases of the bat as $A$ and $B$ so that the $y$ component of the center of $B$ is larger than that of $A$.

Let us assume that a thrown ball crosses the $y$-$z$ plane between the time $t$ and $t+\Delta t$, where $\Delta t= 0.05$\[s\] is the time step of our simulation (Fig. \[fig5\](b)). First, we calculate $z_{b}^{'}$ using the $z$ component of the intersection between the $y$-$z$ plane and the line segment connecting ${\bf r}(t)$ and ${\bf r}(t+\Delta t)$, where ${\bf r}(t)$ is the position of the center of mass of a thrown ball at the time $t$. Next, we determine $z_{b}$ as follows: $$z_{b} = z_{b}^{'} + \sigma_{b},$$ where $\sigma_{b}$ represents the random numbers chosen from the normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $0.0366$ m, which is the diameter of an official baseball in Japan.

After getting its College Football Playoff hopes wrecked at Notre Dame on Week 8, No. 21 USC faced Arizona State on Saturday, hoping to remain in control of at least its conference destiny. A raucous crowd roared on the Sun Devils, as ASU looked to hand the Trojans their second consecutive loss and seize control of the Pac-12 South.

The night — like so many other games this season — began with a whimper at USC’s 25-yard line. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold faked a handoff to junior running back Ronald Jones II but was flushed from the pocket. Darnold danced around the backfield, hesitating to pass twice with no options open, and was pulled down to the turf for a 10-yard loss.

But coming off a 49-14 drubbing in South Bend, the Trojans were in no mood for a rerun of the debacle against Notre Dame. This time, they would wind up on the right side of a 48-17 blowout.

161,0,22009,0,"One of my history-minded friends has a long-range political view summed up in three words: liberals always win. Complex social struggles may take centuries or decades, he says, but they eventually bring victory for human rights, more democratic liberties, and achievement of other progressive goals.

Look how long it took to end slavery. Generations of agitation and the horrible Civil War finally brought triumph for liberal abolitionists and defeat for conservative slavery supporters.

Look how long it took for women to gain the right to vote. In the end, liberal suffragettes prevailed, conservative opponents lost.

Look at the long battle to give couples the right to practice family planning through the use of birth control. Planned Parenthood founder (and 1957 Humanist of the Year) Margaret Sanger was jailed eight times for the crime of mentioning sex, but she eventually transformed U.S. society. A Supreme Court victory in 1965 (Griswold v. Connecticut) struck down contraceptive bans for married couples, and a follow-up victory in 1972 (Eisenstadt v. Baird) struck them down for unwed partners. Liberals won, conservatives lost.

The same pattern applies to the struggle for Social Security pensions for retirees. And unemployment compensation for the jobless. And Medicare and Medicaid. And food stamps for needy families. And expanded health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And marriage equality for gays. And so on. These stormy social conflicts so often end the same way: liberals win; conservatives lose. America’s legendary civil rights crusade that eventually wiped out Jim Crow segregation was a classic example of liberal victory.

Of course, history doesn’t move in a clear, predictable manner. Germany was advanced and modern, yet it sank into the horrors of Nazism. Racial inequality persists the world over. And women, who still haven’t achieved pay equity with their male counterparts, are seeing ongoing attempts to curb their reproductive rights. Other setbacks occur, but the overall tide of civilization flows in a progressive direction.

In his landmark 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, Harvard psychologist (and 2006 Humanist of the Year) Steven Pinker concludes that all sorts of human evils—war, genocide, murder, rape, torture, domestic violence, attacks on minorities—have faded enormously from the Western world. War between nations has virtually vanished. Pursuit of humane goals lies at the heart of the liberal agenda.

When I first became a news reporter in the 1950s, conservative Bible Belt morality was enforced by law. It was a crime for stores to open on the Sabbath. It was a crime to look at pornography or to read a sexy book. (Our mayor once sent cops to raid bookstores selling Peyton Place.)

Back then, it was a felony to be gay, and those who were caught engaging in homosexual sex acts were sent to prison under sodomy laws. Back then, it was a felony for a desperate girl to end a pregnancy. It was illegal for an unmarried couple to share a bedroom. Divorce or unwed pregnancy was an unmentionable disgrace. Jews weren’t allowed into Christian-only country clubs. Public schools had mandatory teacher-led prayer. It was a crime to buy a cocktail or a lottery ticket.

That world disappeared, decade after decade. The culture slowly evolved. Sunday “blue laws” were undone. Teacher-led prayers were banned. Gay sex became legal. Liquor clubs were approved. Abortion was legalized and therefore made safe. State governments became lottery operators. Censorship ended. Other conservative taboos gradually disappeared",736,11,".

My problem is i have the book knowledge, however i do not have a very good hands on exp,So i'm unable to think myself as an consultant and judge a correct answer to the question which is asked in the exam. Is there a way of writing the exam? or is there any way to practice for this?

In the course, the instructor would have asked you questions about certain aspects of the 10 and 1 - but solely on 1 process or function per question

What you need to do is be able to is take all of the kinds of questions that were asked -
Describe, list, explain, etc and work out for each process the answers,

1 - Every night until the course exam, you work with one process. you list describe, compare / contrast quesiton and you do it by hand writing the answers double space.

YOU SHOULD KNOW BY HEART AND DEEP IN YOUR HEAD THE BENEFITS, PARTS, COSTS, ETC FOR EACH PROCESS

Sorry about the UPPER Case - but it is important

The exam is not about reurgitating the information. It is about taking the information in each process and applying it to a specific situation ( question) and explaining the requested key points_________________John Hardesty

Unfortunately, however, monoclonal antibodies are often unable to cure diseases when used as monotherapy. Bispecific antibodies can potentially overcome some of the limitations of monoclonal antibody therapy, e.g. they could be used as mediators to target a drug or toxic compound to target cells, as mediators to retarget effector mechanisms to disease-associated sites or as mediators to increase specificity for tumor cells, for example by binding to a combination of targets molecules that is exclusively found on tumor cells.
Different formats and uses of bispecific antibodies have recently been reviewed by Chames and Baty (2009) Curr Opin Drug Disc Dev 12: 276.

171,0,29275,0,"Free will. Free market. What's so hard to understand about that?

Responsibility isn’t something people are born with. It’s learned. It’s learned by prioritizing, making tradeoffs, weighing the benefits, costs, and risks of alternative courses of action, and dealing with the consequences of one’s decisions.

When an overprotective parent spoils their child by shielding them from hard lessons, or gives the child whatever it wants so the child will love them more, they fail to instill in the child a sense of responsibility. Instead they encumber it with a false sense of entitlement to whatever the child desires. Later, the child is faced with a rude awakening when thrust into a world where it has to compete with others who are accustomed to making hard choices and working for the things they desire.

Once a sense of entitlement is engrained in someone’s belief system, it’s difficult to overcome. Developing a sense of responsibility is counter to their conditioning, and they cannot easily grasp the notion that they are really not entitled to anything they haven’t earned. When something doesn’t come easily, instead of getting fired up with a sense of determination to work harder and make the necessary sacrifices to achieve their goal, they feel resentful that it isn’t provided for them. Whatever nominal effort they put into it seems like it ought to be enough. They feel a deep sense of personal injustice that they can’t have things that other people have, oblivious to the tradeoffs and sacrifices others have had to make to acquire those things.

In the real world, nobody is entitled to own a house. If you can’t afford a house, the responsible thing to do is to work and save and sacrifice until you can afford to buy one. By encouraging people to buy houses they really can’t afford, the government sets them up for failure later on when the house payments become a burden they cannot sustain. And when that time comes, the “homeowners” won’t consider that, until their mortgage is paid in full, the house isn’t actually theirs. Instead, they’ll feel entitled to the house in which they’re living, and deeply resentful of losing it.

A person who buys a house incurs a responsibility. If they’re shielded from the full impact of the responsibility they’re incurring, by making it easier than it would be (in a free market) for them to assume it, it gives them a false sense of security and makes the responsibility seem lighter than it is. That is not a wise thing to do. And the current economic crisis is a perfect illustration of that folly. Yet the government is going down the same path again, with the FHA taking on the role once played by AIG.

This is just one of many examples of the government fostering an entitlement mentality in its citizens. Perhaps, like the parent who spoils their child in an attempt to buy its love, politicians see this as a way to buy votes. But, like overprotective parents trying to make life easier for their precious dumplings, when government shields people from the onus of personal responsibility, it does not strengthen them; it weakens them. And it not only weakens the individual beneficiaries of the government’s largesse, it weakens the entire economy, and the underlying moral fiber of our nation.

172,0,27348,0,"Users who wish to access data stored at a remote location and/or remote computer-implemented services typically do so via a telecommunications network, such as the Internet. In order to transmit and receive data via a telecommunications network, users conventionally subscribe to a telecommunications service provided by a telecommunications service provider. A telecommunications service typically provides access to a wider telecommunications network for a given subscriber client device, a group of subscriber client devices, or a residential or commercial premises network associated with a given subscriber. The service provider network typically performs subscriber authentication and comprises a routing fabric for routing traffic between an authenticated subscriber and the wider telecommunications network. A service provider may comprise a carrier, a mobile network operator (MNO), a wireless network operator or an internet service provider (ISP). Subscriber client devices may include personal computers, laptop computers, mobile telephones (including “smart phones”), tablet computers, personal digital assistants, etc.
FIG. 1A shows a simplified example of a telecommunications network 100. A subscriber client device 102 may initially access a service provider network 104 of the telecommunications network 100, which contains various entities provisioned by the service provider. A service provider network 104 for a carrier or a mobile network operator may comprise at least one of: a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network and a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network, e.g. implementing one of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standards. In certain cases, the service provider network 104 may comprise a radio access network and a core network, e.g. as coupled by one or more service edge components. The radio access network may comprise one or more base stations (such as node base-stations—NBs—or enhanced node base-stations—eNBs). User equipment (such as mobile telephones, so-called smartphones, laptops and tablets, amongst others) may attach to the core network via the radio access network. The core network may comprise a serving gateway, a packet data network gateway and a gateway general packet radio service (GPRS) support node. User equipment may connect to other public packet switched networks, e.g. the Internet, via the core network of the service provider. Service provider entities may be responsible for authentication of subscribers/subscriber client devices, access management, billing, etc. This may be performed in association with a home subscriber server or user profile server function (or an authentication centre for GSM) within the service provider network 104. In this manner, the service provider network 104 typically acts as a gateway between subscriber client device 102 and a wider network 106, such as the public internet. The wider network 106 is, at least in part, used to route data between service provider network 104 and one or more server devices 108.
Telecommunications network 100 may also comprise a number of further network parts (not shown), and a number of border/gateway/caching entities (not shown) used to translate between the various network protocols used in each network part where necessary, cache and serve commonly-accessed data so as to reduce load between network parts, and/or manage access to each network part.
Access to data and/or computer-implemented services via telecommunications network 100 is typically enabled using browser software or other applications (hereinafter “a browser”) on subscriber client device 102. Other applications on subscriber client device 102 may include games or software utilities that also require access to content via telecommunications network 100. For example, some applications accrue revenue by displaying content to their users. Such content is typically regularly updated and hosted at a server device in telecommunications network 100. The application may therefore require access to the server device via telecommunications network 100 in order to obtain up-to-date content to display to its users.
A browser enables subscriber client device 102 to take part in a browser session, which comprises a series of one or more requests and responses made to and received from one or more remote entities, such as server device 108, via telecommunications network 100. A browser may be used to view web pages, obtain files, conduct services such as instant messaging, etc. via telecommunications network 100. Browser session requests and responses typically comprise one or more data packets. Such packetized data is formatted and transported according to one or more network protocols, used in a given part of the network.
In patent publication WO 2013190334, an intermediate network device 110 is introduced into service provider network 104 between subscriber client device 102 and wider network part 106. This is shown in FIG. 1B",928,11,. Intermediate network device 110 may be physically located in service
173,0,20461,0,"Into my mail box the other day fell the last issue of the Weekly Standard. Not that you likely care, gentle reader, in that TWS’s diminished supply of readers, gentle or otherwise, polished off a literate conservative magazine of considerable public worth. I take up the topic anyway on account of its relevance to who we are and how we vote. My thesis: We’re still figuring it out, amid pain and high cost. As we go into the new year, no resolution seems likely. I see opportunity, nonetheless. Let us consider.

Back to the Weekly Standard, of which I am — was — a charter subscriber. How come a magazine dedicated to entrenching the conservative vision went kersplat? The magazine business has been a major victim of the internet, but this particular magazine’s big problem was that there isn’t any unified conservative vision these days. Witness the stew our non-conservative president cooks up on a daily basis — some days doing conservative things (e.g., easing federal regulation, appointing conservative judges) and other days doing non-conservative things, certainly by pre-Trump standards (e.g., proclaiming himself “a tariff man,” and acting like it; disabling the U.S. presence in the Middle East). The Standard’s editors were free with their criticism of Trump. That inspired Trumpians to fling criticisms back at the editors.

Things were simpler in ye olden tyme. If you were conservative half a century ago you were for Barry Goldwater, and that was it (and still kind of is, in a sweet, nostalgic sense). You read Bill Buckley in National Review, and you understood why Joe McCarthy had acted the way he had even if you didn’t like him — a preview, possibly, of what it means to “understand” Donald Trump and yet avert your eyes whenever he tweets.

No, it’s not much like the old days despite the survival of the old labels, conservative and liberal, whose relevance to our present perplexities is less plain than formerly. A conservative wants, supposedly, to conserve. But conserve what, and how? That would be, or should be, the operative question. Trump voters, and certainly the man himself, seem more intent on kicking over the furniture than on refurbishing the upholstery.

Meantime, liberals, led by Bernie Sanders and the suddenly, and unaccountably, famous Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, are morphing into “progressives.” Progressives? That’s a good one. It’s “progress” when you strangle economic growth with new, unaffordable programs, (e.g., “Medicare for all,” the $15 minimum wage)? The old conservatism, à la Goldwater, Buckley, and Ronald Reagan, saw Big Government as obstructing the right to be free, and thus to prosper in accordance with one’s own hopes and dreams. That was what we wanted to conserve — an environment of freedom. And for a while we mostly did: conspicuously by helping human nature, and maybe the Lord Himself, engineer the downfall of oppression in Russia.

We’re fighting it out now to see who ends up on top in our new age — self-styled conservatives, unsure exactly what they want to conserve; or self-styled liberals, mainly sure for the moment they’re against everything Donald Trump ever thought about doing, much less did.

A certain weariness descends. We’ve been over this ground before. Here we are again. Thus the frustration both of Trumpians and of voters who can’t speak the Trump name without expectorating. We need, I submit, to keep our eyes on the comparative inconsequentiality both of Donald Trump and of Nancy Pelosi.

What are we trying to do here, folks, as a country, as a society? Do we want to be free, or what? And if “what,” then to what end? America’s wrangling, raucous conservatives would be well-advised, starting now, to lay aside the purity tests and the back-biting — characteristics of any turbulent time — and come up with a common program that restores human freedom to its pedestal and inspires us to desire with great desire its conservation, its long continuance among us.

The Ocasio-Cortezes, like the wilier Pelosis, can spell “freedom,” and that’s about it. Their focus on government as all-purpose therapist, as toll collector on the economic highway, wouldn’t be something, would it, that Americans in general care to “conserve”?

The Prince Bandroom, Melbourne

October 14th, 2016

Reviewed by Rod Whitfield

Photography by Sofie Marsden

A few weeks ago, I wrote a memoir for HEAVY Magazine of my first ever live music experience, Dio at Festival Hall, 30 years to the day [ http://bit.ly/29NxTNj ]. Entering the Prince Bandroom last night just, as Elm Street were starting their set, I thought I had stepped through a time-warp regarding the band’s sound and presentation. This feeling was heightened by the punters who had shown up to with their cut-off denim jackets festooned with Iron Maiden and Motorhead patches, just as I had worn as a 15-year-old way back on that cold night in the mid-’80’s.

Elm Street was up first with their blistering, traditional thrash metal. Thrash isn’t the perfect choice to open up the night for a band like Queensryche and therefore didn’t elicit much of a positive reaction from the growing crowd. However, and understandably so, because they were ring-in’s because Teramaze had to pull out due to their drummer’s leg injury which required surgery. If it were a thrash night, Elm Street would have knocked the crowd’s socks off with their almost cliche riffs and antics.

Vanishing Point came on next and seriously lifted the vibe with their grand and soaring take on the power metal sub-genre. Just back from the Power-Prog Festival in the USA, it is easy to see why Vanishing Point are one of Australia’s favourite power metal exports and have been for years and years. Decades even. Their songs are joyous, catchy, skilfully played, full of energy, with subtle symphonic touches and beautifully sung by Silvio Massaro.

Twenty plus years in this harsh industry we call the “music biz” does not seem to have blunted the passion, creativity and enthusiasm of this band one single iota. They still appear to be having an absolute ball up there, especially",470,11, long-time guitarist Chris Porcianko who laid

The present invention concerns a defoaming apparatus for use in the aerobic fermentative production of useful chemical and biological substances, as well as methods of defoaming and controlling aerobic fermentation cultures in the production of useful chemical and biological substances.
2. Discussion of the Background
In the fermentation industry, aerobic microorganisms are generally used for producing useful chemical and biological substances. Such aerobic microorganisms are cultured in a culture tank or fermentation tank, containing a liquid culture medium. Where a large amount of air is blown into a culture liquid, foams are expected to be generated. If the generated foams are not reduced or eliminated during culturing, the tank is filled with the scum of the foams, causing the scum to overflow into the exhaust system of the culture tank. In particular, if the amount of the culture liquid is relatively large compared with the capacity of the culture tank (approximately 70% or more of the tank capacity), then the possibility of scum or foam overflowing into the exhaust system increases dramatically.
In general, methods of defoaming are employed for the purpose of inhibiting foaming during fermentative culturing. In one method, a foam detector is provided in the culture tank, and a defoaming agent (a surfactant or silicone) is added to the tank (for instance, see C. L. Kroll et al.; I.E.C., 48, 2190 (1956)). In accordance with this method, however, the amount of defoaming agent in the tank is difficult to control. Therefore, productivity using this method is low.
Another defoaming method employs defoaming blades disposed above the stirring blades in the fermentation tank, to act on areas or surfaces of vapor (air)-liquid contact. In general, as fermentation progresses, components such as nutrient sources and pH-altering substances are added to the culture medium. In accordance with the defoaming method employing defoaming blades, however, the scum of the foams generated is merely pushed back into the medium as the amount of the culture liquid in the culture tank increases. Using only the device of this method, complete control of the scum surface of the foams generated is impossible.
In fermentative production operations typically used at the commercial plant level, a combined method is used in which the scum surface of the generated foams is detected with an electrode sensor disposed in the upper area of the culture tank (above the surface of the culture medium), and a surfactant and a silicone chemical agent are added to the tank as defoaming agents. The scum surface of the generated foams is thus retained in the lower portion of the culture medium below the defoaming blades (for instance, see Japanese Patent Publication No. 46-30786, and FIG. 4 herein).
In accordance with this combined method, however, the amount of the culture liquid to be charged into the culture tank is limited due to the defoaming blades. Increasing the amount of culture liquid increases the amount of power necessary to turn the stirring and defoaming blades. Generally, when the amount of culture liquid increases to that amount requiring about three times the original power to turn the blades, vigorous foaming occurs. At this point, the power necessary to turn the blades exceeds the maximum capacity of conventional motors. As a result, the space in the upper area of the culture tank is not utilized efficiently. Further, the product output and/or the efficiency of production as a function of energy input is reduced, compared with methods which expend energy to rotate only the stirring blades.
Other defoaming means include a method of removing the scum of foams by providing a separate rotor in the upper area of the culture tank (above the surface of the liquid culture medium), and rotating the rotor by an electric motor at a high speed to remove the scum of the foams generated during fermentation (for instance, see I. H. Muller; Process Biochem., 37 (June, 1972)); and a defoaming tank having horizontally rotating blade propellers disposed at the exhaust outlet (see Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 39-36996).

For Henry, life is not a universal, blind, impersonal and abstract substance, it is necessarily the personal and concrete life of a living individual, it carries in it a consubstantial Ipseity which refers to the fact of being itself, to the fact of being a Self. This life is the personal and finite life of men, or the personal and infinite life of God.

Two modes of manifestation 

Two modes of manifestation of phenomena exist, according to Henry, which are two ways of appearing: ""exteriority"", which is the mode of manifestation of the visible world, and phenomenological ""interiority"", which is the mode of manifestation of invisible life. Our bodies, for instance, are in life given to us from the inside, which allows us, for example, to move our hands, and it also appears to us from the outside like any other object that we can see in the world.

The ""invisible"", here, does not correspond to that which is too small to be seen with the naked eye, or to radiation to which the eye is not sensitive, but rather to life, which is forever invisible because it is radically immanent and never appears in the exteriority of the world.  No-one has ever seen a force, a thought or a feeling appear in the world in their inner reality; no-one has ever found them by digging into the ground.

Some of his assertions seem paradoxical and difficult to understand at first glance, not only because they are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.

Critique of Western philosophy 
Western philosophy as a whole since its Greek origins recognizes only the visible world and exteriority as the sole form of manifestation. It is trapped into what in The Essence of Manifestation Michel Henry calls ""ontological monism""; it completely ignores the invisible interiority of life, its radical immanence and its original mode of revelation which is irreducible to any form of transcendence or to any exteriority. When subjectivity or life are in question, they are never grasped in their purity;  they are systematically reduced to biological life, to their external relation with the world, or as in Husserl to an intentionality, i.e. an orientation of consciousness towards an object outside it.

Henry rejects materialism, which admits only matter as reality, because the manifestation of matter in the transcendence of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or to be able to see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.

The deep originality of  Michel Henry's thought and its radical novelty in relation to all preceding philosophy explains its fairly limited reception. It is however a philosophy that is admired for its ""rigor"" and its ""depth"".    But his thought is both ""difficult"" and ""demanding"",",714,11, despite the simplicity and immediacy of its central and unique

EXTREME RIGHT

CHARLESTON, South Carolins — Breitbart News asked former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), Democratic presidential hopeful, about his remark Monday evening at the College of Charleston in which he repeated the “very fine people” hoax about President Donald Trump’s reaction to the riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

During the event, part of the College of Charleston’s “Bully Pulpit” series, O’Rourke claimed that President Trump is responsible for acts of white supremacist violence in the United States. He misquoted Trump several times, claiming, for example, that the president had referred to immigrants as an “infestation” and “animals” (he was referring to gangs, specifically the El Salvadoran gang MS-13, which rapes, murders, and mutilates its victims).

O’Rourke claimed that Trump’s rhetoric was “giving permission for exactly what took place in El Paso on August 3rd” (i.e. the mass shooting that killed 22 people). He added: “And lest you think this is an isolated strain of his hatred — this is the same man who called Klansmen, and neo-Nazis, and white supremacists ‘very fine people’ days after they were marching in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting: ‘Jews, you will not replace us!’”

O’Rourke also said that the U.S. needed a president who would “heal” rather than “inflame” national tensions.

In a press conference afterwards, Breitbart News asked O’Rourke why he continued to misquote the president:

Breitbart News: The president, Trump, after Charlottesville, said that he condemned the white supremacists and the neo-Nazis “totally.” Are you aware that you are misquoting him, or partially quoting him — no quoting the full extent of his remarks in Charlottesville? Are you concerned that that might inflame tensions rather than heal divisions?

Beto O’Rourke: No. I believe in the truth, and in being honest about what the president was doing. And it’s not just that he referred to Klansmen as “very fine people,” it’s that he attempted to ban all people of one religion from this country. We’re constantly warned of an “invasion” of killers, and rapists, and animals, from Central America and Mexico, though we know that they commit crimes at a far lower rate than those who are born in this country. This is a very coordinated attack on minorities in this country, on the most vulnerable and the defenseless, for political gain for the president. And he knows full well that it not only offends our sensibilities as a country, it is leading to violence and the taking of lives, as we saw in El Paso.

Breitbart News: But he said that he wasn’t referring to the neo-Nazis and the Klansman — just a clarification — he said he wasn’t referring to the Klansmen as “very fine people,” that he was referring to non-violent protesters, left and right.

Beto O’Rourke: He has openly courted the support of white supremacists and that’s a matter of fact and a matter of record. He has repeatedly, though given the opportunity, refused to disavow their support. I reference — and you can check the tape on this one — at a rally in Florida in May, when someone says, “Shoot them!”, referring to immigrants, he laughs and smiles and he joked about that. If that is not a total failure of leadership, and a total inducement to violence and hatred, I don’t know what is. And you can also check a rise",846,11," in hate crimes in this country, every single year that"

New Yorker hosts a Thursday tea party in Bryant Park

NEW YORK–This city is known for its fast pace of life, and New Yorkers are constantly on the move. However, one woman has made a point of taking a pause and getting to know her neighbors.

Five years ago, Liz Gannon-Graydon would go with her children to Broadway in Bryant Park on Thursdays. On a Thursday evening during the summer, the former teacher was in the park with her kids and friends. Some of the group walked to a nearby kiosk for coffee, but Gannon-Graydon wasn’t interested. One pal mentioned she was more of a tea drinker, and Gannon-Graydon said she was as well.

However, the friend said she really only enjoyed drinking tea out of a proper teacup. From that point, an idea was born.

At first, it started off as a small operation. Gannon-Graydon would bring a couple of china teacups that belonged to her mother and grandmother, and decided to grab a few extra cups in case people stopped by. Then she thought she’d also bring a nice tablecloth.

“That was how it started almost accidentally as a way to just kind of have a nice tea party in the park,” she told The Epoch Times.

For the last five years from the first week of March through the Christmas season, she has been hosting a free tea party in Bryant Park on Thursdays from noon until nightfall, weather permitting. However, this isn’t some minor operation.

To prepare, Gannon-Graydon wakes up at 5 a.m., and starts making seasonal baked goods, which she and friends pack along with about 35 teacups and saucers, tablecloths, napkins, sandwiches, and of course, tea leaves. She then travels from her home on Long Island into the city. When arriving in Bryant Park, she corrals some tables and chairs and sets up.

Around the same time she started her tea party in Bryant Park, her father was slipping deeper into Alzheimer’s. However, it was something he had said when she was a child that stuck with her.

“My dad had been a college professor and a civil rights activist in the 60s, and my first memory of the world was the assassination of Martin Luther King [Jr.],” she said.

“I was four years old, and I didn’t understand it, and was asking my dad to kind of explain how that could happen, and he said ‘Liz, there are things we are never going to understand, but the work that Martin left undone was the work of creating the beloved community.’ And he said ‘That’s your job. You’re here to create beloved community.'”



Gannon-Graydon tries to create that sense of fellowship with her tea parties. She sets up the gathering with the idea that everyone and anyone is welcome. There are about 15 regulars, but anyone who walks by is also offered an invitation. If they make eye contact with her, she asks them to sit",679,11," down.

189,0,26665,0,"Contrary to the image of many Northerners and visitors to Florida the summer months are the not the greatest time for Florida hurricanes. September is often viewed as a great time to come to Florida and enjoy warm weather, amusement parks minus most school children, and lower prices. It is also, unfortunately, the time of Florida’s greatest and most hurricanes in history.

In reality the hurricane season in the tropics runs to December although September and October have been the most serious months in Florida’s hurricane history.

Here are some of the most serious myths and dumbest behaviors that people, Florida residents or not, have about living with a hurricane.

Myth: I bought a tenth floor condo apartment on the Gulf so I am more are safe in a storm.

Reality: Wind speed increases the higher you go (skyscrapers can feel like they’re swaying on a really windy day). Higher wind speed could blow out windows. Also, if the area floods around you, it makes rescue very tough. If you need to evacuate, get out, not up.

This Is Jacksonville area – not South Florida

Myth: Storm windows are expensive and take time to put up and I hate nailing ugly plywood to my beautiful house. I tape your windows with duct tape or masking tape to prevent them from breaking in a storm.

Reality: It doesn’t. Period. If something hits a window during a hurricane, it likely will hit it with such force that no amount of tape can save the window. In fact, it may make it worse, because the windows may break into bigger shards of glass, which can cause serious injuries.

Myth: Whenever a hurricane nears my town, I fill my bathtub so my family has drinking water during and after a storm.

Reality: My wife and I live in Tampa and buy Zephryhills Spring Water to drink. Gads! Do you have a water purification system attached to your bath water? You can use bath water for washing clothes, bathing or helping in flushing toilets but please buy bottled water instead. Bottled water, stored in a cool, dry place can last for years.

Even a Road At Alligator Point Can’t Beat Ocean Waves

Myth: I only consider leaving my beach cottage when it is a category 2 storm for tropical storms and category 1 and 2 hurricanes are no big deal.

Reality: Every storm has unique characteristics so even if your house was OK with a category 1 or 2 storm, there might have been factors. In which direction was the wind? Was it low or high tide?

The common belief that the worst thing about a hurricane or tropical storm is the wind speeds is false. That’s really not the worst part of a storm. The most dangerous part of a storm is water, from storm surge and from flooding.

Some of the worst flooding and most deaths have taken place during category 1 and 2 storms that flooded rivers and collapsed sea walls.

Myth: If you crack open a window on the opposite side of a storm you equalize pressure in the home and neutralize the winds.

Reality: People in Tornado Alley often believe this until a 150 mile per hour tornado levels their house. An open window will not affect your house’s ability to stop flying debris and crashing trees. You will not balance air pressure by your actions.

Myth: I’ll be vacationing in the Orlando area not the coast so I will be safe.

Reality: Ever point in Florida is less than eighty miles from the coast and Florida is so flat that huge hurricanes lose very little power going across the state. One storm in 2004 went across Florida from Atlantic to Gulf and liked Florida so much it came back Gulf to Atlantic.

190,0,20772,0,"Organic Isn’t Vegan

[ EDIT (8/28/2017): My views on Organic have adjusted a bit recently to be more charitable towards the practice. Certainly the appeal to nature includes animals and precludes “unnatural” technological solutions. That contrived dichotomy can have harmful implications as I write about below but I don’t mean this to be anti-Organic necessarily. A post on that is in my queue. ]

You can hardly swing a bunch of kale without hitting a vegan product that is certified organic these days. Why is this, I wonder? I mean, we should all know by now that organic farming is just like regular agriculture except it uses what is “natural” as its measure. What is naturally derived, without humans (who themselves are a product of nature, BTW), isn’t a guarantee of safeness or goodness. Organic agriculture uses pesticides, isn’t healthier, and not necessarily better for the environment than modern agriculture. But what does this have to do with veganism?

Vegans are typically astute ethical consumers who carefully weigh the consequences of their purchases. They are careful to reduce the chances of participating in any form of animal exploitation mostly by avoiding certain products. There are products made from animal bodies themselves, like flesh. Products that are made by animal bodies, like milk. And animal-derived products that, while not ingredients of a final product, are used in processing (for example, bone char filtration in the sugar-making process). As I’ve written in the past, this can go on to an absurd degree, but I’d concede that, in general",346,11,", vegans focus is on the most obvious animals products"
191,0,20130,2050,", a society in all its colours—in which everyone is comfortable being who they are—comes to my mind. I see a society in which the political ideals of fraternity and equality have been accepted by our collective mind, in which we are so informed and educated that we never allow communalistic designs of sycophants to succeed.

I imagine an India where everyone has a voice, not just because the constitution has given her a voice, but because others let her speak and encourage her to speak if she doesn’t. In my India, everyone should be able to use her voice without fear, especially against those who want to benefit from the differences of People. An India in which everyone is an equal partner and doesn’t have to ‘sell’ his ‘voice’ in exchange for a privilege, which should be his right. An India in which an imposed equality has been naturalized.

Having said that, two major two issues are plaguing India, both connected and blocking India’s progress towards a visionistic future.

Problem 1: Centralization Of Power

One is of course: the centralization of power via a devious mechanism, prevalent throughout the world and an opposition which (I must humbly accept) could not offer a solid defense; the citizens of India gave too much power in the hands of one person/party. This centralization of power is two-fold: one, how power got concentrated in the hands of one political party with a well-known political mission of control and exclusion, and the other: how that power in the political party is concentrated in one or two hands. This is alarming because no democracy can live through such a concentration of power, without getting derailed. In such cases, there is no democracy, in effect.

When power is centralized in a few hands, the idea of ‘partnership’ goes to the bins because a section of society (who are on the receiving end of those in power) go ‘rogue’ and start flexing their arms, and can spew all the venom inside them. They become unabashed and start ‘breaking’ the rules (which is on a whole new plane as compared with the idea of ‘skirting’ the rules). They thrust aside anyone who does not agree with him, and this is visible everywhere. I do not need to point out various incidents exemplifying a case in point specifically. Today, the centralization of power has led to a devious form of intolerance, and violence has become the norm.

Problem 2: Deeply Hierarchical Social Stratification

The second problem thwarting any possible vision for India is deeply (often not visible to naked eyes) hierarchical social stratification. It is important to note that diversity is not the problem; a multicultural society is not the problem. The problem is social stratification, gradations of the communities and sub-communities, encoded in books like Manusmriti and now thought-structures of people. These deeply embedded notions of hierarchy conflict with the idea of partnership, according to which, despite our differences, we should be politically equal.

A possible, and in my opinion, the most powerful tool against the above-mentioned two-pronged enemies of social stratification (visible in the form of centralization and hierarchy-based division of society) is LOVE. Man, by his animalistic nature, is after power, yes. But the most powerful thing in the world is love, however abstract it may sound.

But again, love is abstract because it is very difficult to articulate in the form of ‘deeply scientific (post-reason)’ language that all humankind possesses. What we may not articulate in language does not necessarily have to be non-existent. And we just need to look at common examples from life. Love, somehow, rules the actions of people.

We do things for people we love, we fight for them, we travel hundreds of kilometers for them. Love is more primal to us than is often mentioned. Love is the most natural thing amongst us humans, and not just humans, all the animals understand what love is. I don’t think I need to give specific examples.

Now, this feeling of love, so central to us despite our differences becomes a common locus for us. We interact with each other, we hug each other, we forget our identities, we forget if we are Hindus or Muslims. We get rid of the notions of superiority/inferiority based on the caste-system. And I think by way of normalization, a continuous application of love for fellow beings, can rid us of the social and political walls that divide us.

I have a vision of India, where in addition to the Constitution, love is another central force. Where love is the playground where our actions take place. In",1009,11," my vision of India, we should be able to see"

194,0,25237,0,"Pentacon Six mount

The Pentacon Six mount (commonly abbreviated to P6, or Б in Cyrillic) is a breech-lock bayonet lens mount originally used by several medium format single-lens reflex cameras from East Germany.

The lens mount was originally designed by Carl Zeiss Jena and Kamera Werkstätten (KW) for the Praktisix camera. KW later merged with several other companies to become VEB Pentacon; the Praktisix was improved and renamed the Pentacon Six. This camera was manufactured for a much longer time (almost 40 years) and exported widely; hence the lens mount became associated most with the Pentacon Six name, rather than the original Praktisix.

Variants

Original 

The P6 mount is a simple bayonet mount. It has three short tabs on the lens; they are identical and correct orientation is assured by the placement of a post in front of the ""top"" tab. A pin holds the diaphragm open for fully open metering and focusing; this pin is released before the shutter is opened. The flange focal distance of mount is 74.1 mm.

The lens is inserted into the front of the camera and is held in place by a rotating collar.

This variant is seen on the Praktisix, Pentacon Six, Kiev 6C and Kiev 60.

Exakta 66 

The Exakta 66 added a TTL metered prism coupled to the shutter speed dial on the camera body and the aperture ring on the lens. It does this by projecting slightly over the front of the camera, allowing a rotating cam on the specially designed Schneider lenses to tell it what aperture setting was selected. And for lenses with a maximum aperture other than, a separate pin projects from the lens to the prism to tell it the maximum aperture.

Kiev 88 modifications 

The Kiev 88 is essentially a clone of the first Hasselblad - the 1600F/1000F. Like the Hasselblad, it has a threaded lens mount and Kiev-Arsenal manufactured its lens range in both the Pentacon Six mount (for the Kiev 60) and the Kiev 88 screw mount. However, there was interest in using Pentacon Six mount lenses from Carl Zeiss Jena and others on this camera (nicknamed the Hasselbladski). Thus various third parties worked to machine a P6-compatible lens mount into the Kiev 88. A major issue is the fact that the Kiev 88 has a greater flange focal distance than the Pentacon Six, requiring the lens to be recessed into the front of the modified Kiev 88. This causes physical clearance issues with some lenses, particularly the Exakta 66 lenses with a cam and possibly a pin for coupling the lens to a TTL prism.

A consequence of these early modifications is that the lens mount became twist-lock instead of breach-lock; the lens is inserted and turned.

Kiev 88СМ 

The Kiev 88СМ is a later version of the Kiev 88 manufactured with a P6 mount from the factory. Like the earlier Kiev 88 modifications, the lens is recessed in the front of the camera body. However it returns to the breach-lock origins of the mount. It has an ""internal collar"" that is turned by a tab accessible from the front of the camera.

“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”

– Ben Franklin

At Stellar, our core mission is to leverage education and local knowledge to extend financial access to the 2.5 billion unbanked people worldwide. We do this through a technology that enables money to move directly between people, companies and financial institutions as easily as email, increasing interoperability between diverse financial systems and currencies. Mobile economic tools that can span wide geographic areas at a low cost are a critical component of our efforts. And as we explore powerful ways to alleviate poverty through digital financial services, we need to think in particular about how those tools can reach women and girls.

Why girls?

In many cultures, it’s hard to separate a woman’s identity from her economic relationships with others – so lack of access to financial services serves to perpetuate gender inequality.

In the developing world, only 37 percent of women have bank accounts. Research from Women’s World Banking has shown that poor women are inherent savers, putting away 10-15 percent of their earnings for emergencies. Due to a lack of financial services, however, they’re forced to save in unreliable and sometimes expensive ways — women often hide cash in their homes, where it isn’t secure, or buy livestock, which can become ill or die.

Starting early in a woman’s life, there’s a long list of factors that hinder financial inclusion, including minimum age requirements, lack of formal identification, distance to banks, and difficulty securing permission from familial authorities or other cultural gatekeepers. On top of that, when they do have bank accounts, girls in particular are less likely to maintain hefty balances. Commercial financial institutions are reluctant to design services for small savers, whose accounts they’ve traditionally viewed as prohibitively costly to administer.

We believe that low-cost and reliable methods for saving could have an enormous impact on girls, as well as on their families and communities. Saving not only improves the financial well-being of girls but also nurtures positive attitudes and expectations, building self-esteem and driving productive behavioral changes.

(Above graphic from girlseffect.org)

How Vumi reaches women

When Stellar began digging into this issue, we met the team at the Praekelt Foundation, an amazing nonprofit based in South Africa that has been using open-source technologies to deliver essential information and inclusive services to millions of people living in poverty. Since its founding, Praekelt’s programs have reached over 50 million people across 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Using Stellar’s open-source protocol, Praekelt is working on a mobile wallet that allows people to save money using Vumi, its messaging platform—think WhatsApp, but open source and designed for the developing world, with a focus on improving the economic security of girls in South Africa. Vumi already powers South Africa’s national maternal health care program, MomConnect, which sends expectant mothers prenatal health information over the course of their pregnancies. After a successful launch in South Africa last year, Praekelt is introducing the service in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.

1. We assume, arguendo (1) that, to give the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, it was not necessary that the guaranty (or the proceeds of its enforcement) be part of the debtor's assets,1 and (2) that, in fact, the guaranty constituted part of the mortgaged property.2 Even so, we think the court, as a bankruptcy court, lacked jurisdiction on the facts here because (a) that jurisdiction could exist only if the suit were a representative action3 for restoration of the trust fund, and (b) under pertinent New York decisions, such a representative action cannot rest upon the indenture trustee's breach where that breach consists merely of inaction — here the failure to enforce the guaranty. Those New York decisions control us, although, as we once pointed out, they may lead to most undesirable results.4 Our discussions in earlier cases5 render it unnecessary here to canvass in detail Smith v. Continental Bank, 292 N.Y. 275, 54 N.E. 2d 823, and related decisions. Suffice it to say that, if the inaction of the trustee in the Smith case could give rise to personal suits only, i. e., not a representative suit for restoration of the fund, then surely the same must be true of the trustee's inaction here. Appellant urges that the Smith case dealt solely with an individual bondholder's suit at law for his personal loss, and that, for the trustee's misconduct alleged in that suit, a representative action for restoration of the fund could also have been maintained against the trustee. We do not agree. The New York courts, as we understand them, hold (a) that such inaction does not amount to a ""release or surrender"" of any mortgaged property, and that, without a ""release or surrender,"" personal, individual suits only — not a representative suit for ""restoration of the fund"" — may be maintained; and also (b) that any such individual suits must be brought by those who held bonds at the time of the trustee's breach, not by subsequent transferees of the bonds (absent express assignments to them of the individual claims against the trustees). We think that (b) results from (a), not vice versa. Accordingly, nothing in the recent New York statute, Personal Property Law, McK.Consol.Laws, c. 41, § 41 (1950), wiping out (b) as to transfers made after September 1, 1950, would affect our decision, even if that statute were retroactive.6

2. We agree with the master and the district judge that there is no merit in appellant's objection to the trustee's surrender of $10,000 in cash for cancelled bonds. The trust agreement did not require, as a condition of such a surrender, compliance with conditions contained in the agreement but applicable to other types of releases.7

This reflects the multi-discipline nature of some projects, however, also at least partially can be explained that biomedical research is seen as trendy, fundable, and likely to get more citations and with results more publishable in high impact journals (1,2). It is also apparent with some publications and lectures that not all these physical scientists/engineers are well-prepared to work on projects which do not align with their own expertise. Some studies are against very basic principles of pharmacology or biology, while others try to solve medical problems which do not exist clinically. I reviewed a number of submissions including a few from prestigious American universities to Nature journals which made no sense with the study design. Much of manpower and financial resource are being wasteful spent. There are also examples of clinical trials which were ill-planned right from the start and in the end only causing much inconvenience to patients to say at the least. In addition, ample examples exist where experienced physical scientists worked with inexperienced medical scientists and resulted in avoidable failures.

In the fields of pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies, for some reasons which have not been fully explained both Japan and South Korea have not been very successful in developing novel drugs. While Japan and South Korea have first-class carmakers such as Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai, Honda, Suzuki etc. and electronics companies such as Samsung, Toshiba, Hitachi, LG, Sony etc., Japanese and South Korean pharmaceutical companies are much less visible. For the year of 2013 of the ten top pharmaceutical companies none of them were Japanese or Korean; and of the 25 top biotech companies none of them were Japanese or Korean (3,4), despite the fact that Japan has been a major geopolitical and economic power since early 20th century and till now produced seven noble prize winners in chemistry (and ten noble prize winners in physics). In one paper written in year 2005, Hashimoto and Haneda quantitatively measured the poorness of Japanese pharmaceutical industry R&D efficiency (5). Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore did not do any better. Japanese pharmaceutical industry realized for some time that they were not very successful in hunting new drugs (partially explained as the ‘creativity problem’), many companies resorted to setting-up pharmaceutical R&D centers in Europe and America, hoping the talents there might help them (6).

201,0,27776,0,"I recently enjoyed participating in a discussion about recursion in R on the new RStudio Community site, and I thought to inaugurate my blog with a post inspired by the discussion.

R supports recursive functions, but does not optimize tail recursive functions the way some other languages do. Fortunately, with a mechanism known as a trampoline, the R programmer can implement something like the optimization manually and with very little code.

To understand trampolines, one must first understand the mechanics of function calls and recursion.

The Call Stack

As in many other languages, functions in R may call themselves. For example, here is a recursive function that decrements its argument until 0 is reached:

function (n) if (n > 0 ) countdown (n -1 ) else ""done"" countdown

This function has no problem with small values of n :

> countdown(10) [1] ""done"" > countdown(100) [1] ""done"" > countdown(1000) [1] ""done

Unfortunately, when n is big enough, an error is raised:

> countdown(10000) Error: C stack usage 7969236 is too close to the limit

The problem here is that the top-most invocation of the countdown function, the one we called with countdown(10000), can’t return until countdown(9999) returned, which can’t return until countdown(9998) returned, and so on.

R keeps track of all of these calls in a data structure called the call stack or sometimes just the stack. The stack contains references to all outstanding function calls, recursive or not.

Since the stack is stored in memory, and since computers only have so much memory, the number of nested calls that can occur in a program is limited.

If we want to decrement a number 10000 or more times and print something when we’re done, we have to do it a different way. That way is to use a loop.

Loops

Here’s the countdown function using a loop instead of recursion:

function (n) { countdown while (n > 0 ) n <- n -1 ; (n) n ""done"" }

It doesn’t overflow the stack:

> countdown(10000) [1] ""done""

The new countdown contains the same essential pieces as the recursive version: the n > 0 test, decrementing n, and returning ""done"" at the end. The pieces are just slightly differently arranged so that countdown doesn’t need to call itself.

If it does what we want, and looks only slightly different than the recursive version… why did we care about recursion again?

Well, maybe we don’t. The choice to use recursion is a stylistic one with arguable benefits. People with a mathematical bent seem to enjoy it. So do I, usually.

Forgoing a debate of the merits of recursive style, let’s assume we want it, and continue on to trampolines: a means to stack-friendly recursive functions.

Trampoline

A trampoline is a function or set of functions that together give us the tools we need to write code in a recursive style, in a way that doesn’t overflow the stack. Here’s an awesome trampoline by Jim Hester:

function (f,...) { trampoline function (...) { (...) { f (...) ret while ( inherits (ret, ""recursion"" )) { (ret,)) { eval ( as.call ( c (f, unclass (ret)))) ret } ret } } function (...) { recur structure ( list (...), class = ""recursion"" ) (...), }

Using it, countdown now looks like this:

trampoline ( function (n) { countdown if (n > 0 ) recur (n -1 ) else ""done"" (n(n })

It’s very close stylistically to the original recursive version, but has no stack issues:

> countdown(10000) [1] ""done""

Mind Powers include such things as Telepathy and Persuasion. Il Dottore prefers finesse over force. A telepath may have a psychic shield, but a similar effect may come from someone with a Tough or Iron Will quality. In general, people with superpowers have a better chance to resist because they can fight back on a similar level even without the same talent, whereas ordinary people without special training in mental skills tend to be a pushover. Gaetan's resistance demonstrates a strong mind and good potential.

Italy is just one of many countries with a population of street children. They typically suffer from abuse and neglect, which makes them reluctant to rely on adults even if help is offered, but those with some kind of positive family background have a better chance of capitalizing on such opportunities.

As nurses watched from window out of sight on left, UFO with two occupants was seen outside of children's ward on top story of this hospital wing. It spanned five windows, starting from left.

A significant factor of this sighting is that none of the witnesses made any effort to publicize it, yet at the same time made no pretence of being secretive. Knowing of our interest in the subject, another nurse at the hospital who is a friend of ours phoned us a little later the same morning and it was through this connection that we arranged the interview which was later reported in the Victoria press.

Immediately the story appeared, the two witnesses, like ourselves, started to receive phone calls by persons who were legitimately and intelligently interested and by others who professed to have exclusive private information about the incident. It was here that we acquired information of our own about people who, for some reason that escapes us, want to establish that they have the inside dope.

Packed too densely with needless smarm and excess songs, “A Christmas Story Live!” stretched itself to three precisely executed but tedious hours Sunday night — including gobs of commercials, one of which was a live song-and-dance commercial for Twentieth Century Fox’s new musical film “The Greatest Showman,” which reeked instantly of box-office desperation and enforced synergy.

Other commercials (Old Navy’s, in particular) were so full of song-and-dance nonsense that it made the experience of watching “A Christmas Story Live!” seem that much longer. At one point I wondered whether Fox would stretch things out to 24 hours in length, the way TBS likes to air the 1983 version of “A Christmas Story” for 24 straight hours on Dec. 24 and 25.

208,0,28189,0,"President Donald Trump proposed extending protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and individuals with Temporary Protected Status in exchange for border wall funding in remarks Saturday afternoon. The proposed deal, however, will likely be dead on arrival due to a lack of support from Democrats.

The President’s latest offer links his demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall to the BRIDGE Act, legislation that would extend protections for so-called “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children and are covered by the DACA program.

The compromise proposal would also allow immigrants covered by Temporary Protected Status — some of whose protections Trump has rescinded — to remain in the country.

The proposal also includes $800 million for urgent humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, as well additional border agents, law enforcement officials and new immigration judge teams to deal with cases of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.

Trump called it a “common sense compromise both parties should embrace” and touted the proposal as “straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense, with lots of compromise.”

While early last year Democratic senators worked on a deal with Republicans which offered $25 billion in border funding in exchange for a permanent path to citizenship for some 1.8 million Dreamers (an offer rejected by the President), the new offer expected to be put on the table by Trump would only extend temporary status, not citizenship, to DACA and TPS recipients.

The lack of a path to citizenship is a nonstarter for Democrats.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Saturday that initial reports of the proposed deal “make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives.”

“It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports,” Pelosi added.

And despite co-sponsoring the BRIDGE Act, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said in a statement Saturday that he would not support the upcoming proposal to reopen the government.

“First, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must open the government today. Second, I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate. Third, I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues,” Durbin said.

A senior administration official told CNN that this proposal remains fluid and could change.

“Democrats were not consulted on this and have rejected similar overtures in the past. It’s clearly a Republican-and-Republican negotiation,” a Democratic congressional aide with direct knowledge of negotiations told CNN.

The makings of a proposal

A source familiar with the discussions said the President tasked his son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Vice President Mike Pence with working to craft a broader compromise proposal that they could present to Democrats.

The three men set out to put together a “fair and reasonable proposal,” engaging with numerous members of Congress in recent weeks, the source said.

The aides then began discussing the proposal with Trump in recent days to get him on board.

As for the timing, the White House wants it to look like they had a valid reason for canceling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Afghanistan, and feared that if there was no movement this weekend — no meetings, no negotiations or no speeches — they would look bad, two people familiar with the schedule told CNN.

Trump’s latest proposal to Congress came together over the last week, with White House officials working into Friday night to hammer out the details and how Trump would lay it out in his Saturday afternoon address.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had floated such a compromise to the President as early as late December.

Another source told CNN the plan is modeled after proposals Democrats have supported and voted for in the past in an added effort to pressure them back to the negotiating table.

The White House, though, hasn’t gotten assurances that Democrats will be open to this. But rather, the proposal is based on conversations with Republicans and a belief that moderate rank-and-file Democrats are more willing to compromise than their party’s leadership.

210,0,28606,1025,".  There is an initial hurdle to get over in starting out with unbiased things, in that you have to have infinitely many operations and axioms, but once you're past that, I agree that the operations and axioms are usually much more natural and proofs happen much more easily.
My favorite example is that while it's true that biased and unbiased monoidal categories are equivalent, the proof of that requires essentially the entire strength of Mac Lane's coherence theorem!  The coherence theorem for unbiased monoidal categories can be shown via 2-categorical abstract nonsense about 2-monads; basically all the difficulty comes from insisting on a biased definition.  I also think that unbiased definitions often lead to more natural categorifications.  For instance, Leinster's unbiased notion of ""contractible globular operad"" fits nicely into a language of weak factorization systems, while I'm not sure if the same is true of Batanin's original biased version.
There is certainly an unbiased definition of Lie algebra, since Lie algebras are the algebras for an operad.  Whether that unbiased definition admits a nice presentation in terms of n-ary operations, I don't know.

A:

Certainly unbiased definitions are the norm in modern homotopy theory.  I guess an example of a biased definition is the (original?) definition by Stasheff of an $A_\infty$ space—the homotopy theorist's monoid.  (For simplicity, I'll ignore matters related to the unit.)  Informally, it consists of a space $X$, a multiplication $\mu : X \times X \to X$, a homotopy $\alpha$ between the maps $\mu(\mu(x,y),z)$ and $\mu(x,\mu(y,z))$ from $X \times X \times X$ to $X$, a ""pentagonator"" $\pi$ which extends a map $S^1 \times X^4 \to X$ built from $\mu$ and $\alpha$ to $D^2 \times X^4$, and so on.  This seems to be the appropriate generalization of your biased definition of monoids to the situation where we need infinitely many higher coherence homotopies.  More precisely, an $A_\infty$ space under this definition consists of a space $X$ together with maps $\mu_n : A_n \times X^n \to X$, where $A_n$ is the $n$th associahedron—a certain convex polyhedron in $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$—and on the boundary of $A_n$, $\mu_n$ is required to be equal to a certain expression built out of the $\mu_k$ for $k$ smaller than $n$.  Thus, we may think of it as a null-homotopy of a prescribed map $\partial A_n \times X^n \to X$.
This definition is quite complicated combinatorially, since it depends on the polyhedra $A_n$.  Peter May realized that certain features of the $A_n$ could be abstracted into the notion of a (non-symmetric) operad.  I don't want to define exactly what an operad is, but instead just observe the change in perspective: rather than thinking of $A_n$ as a space which encodes a null-homotopy of a map defined on its boundary, we think of the points of $A_n$ as describing various $n$-ary multiplications on $X$ via the map $\mu_n : A_n \to \mathrm{Map}(X^n, X)$.  The contractibility of $A_n$ guarantees that there is essentially just one way to multiply $n$-tuples.  So we see that the same definition can be viewed as either biased or unbiased.

Getting A Head Start

Multimedia

High schoolers as young as 16 are providing services to science labs, hospitals and high tech companies  and not just of the coffee-fetching kind. The results are so encouraging that a growing chorus of educators, experts and employers  prodded by the Gates Foundation  is pushing for internships to be incorporated into high school curriculums.

Advocates argue that early introduction into the world of white-collar work offers young Americans a far better chance at navigating this fast-moving, skills-oriented economy.

WHAT IS AN INTERNSHIP?

The internship as defined today is a part-time job of limited duration, paid minimally or unpaid, in which the interns learn while contributing to the organization. Many involve supervision by a school or youth program (Hipps' was arranged by Inroads, a nationwide group that helps young African-Americans into careers).

For employers, internships provide a pool of raw but talented labor from which they can cherry-pick the best and brightest. Among college interns, 90% report job offers from their employers, says CareerExposure.com. Employers rank students' internships and job experiences above grade-point averages in hiring  not surprising in an era when companies from Lockheed Martin to NASA have to engage etiquette trainers to teach new hires just how to shake hands.

Even high schoolers are groomed by companies such as Microsoft; the software giant sinks its hooks into the most promising by reeling them into college internships that often lead to jobs. And internship programs that focus on minority or disadvantaged youth are proving a successful way for large employers to diversify their workforce.

Why younger students are flocking to internships now is a question experts debate. Carl Van Horn, director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, attributes their popularity in part to helicopter parents who ""push"" their kids to stand out in a hypercompetitive college market and employers who ""pull"" younger and younger prospects in to win a hypercompetitive talent race.

Andrew Sum, a sociologist at Northeastern University who studies youth in the workforce, has a bleaker explanation: traditional jobs for youths are disappearing. As immigrants and oldsters crowd the market for jobs flipping burgers or packing groceries, teens are getting squeezed. In 1978, 61% of kids aged 16 to 19 worked; in 2005, it was 40%. Sum's data does not include internships.

I can remember it vividly: it was the day before my birthday, and I was babysitting at a neighbor’s house. I was 14 at the time, and after an unfortunate scooter accident, I fell, broke my wrist, and landed myself in the hospital. It wasn’t a very traumatic experience, and when I went to the orthopedist he asked what color cast I wanted. I said I didn’t care, but I did have one request that sort of baffled him at first. I asked him if he could cut some extra room around my thumb, so I had more dexterity. I also wanted my fingers to be more exposed as to move them around more. He complied, and asked why this was so, since it was a very unusual wish. I stated emphatically and unequivocally: “Resident Evil 4 comes out next week.”

2005 was that awkward period in the gaming industry (and in my life), the one where a new generation of consoles was on the horizon, and things slowed down as the future loomed bright and mysterious. The Xbox 360 had yet to be formally introduced, and publishers were releasing the last great games of the Gamecube and PS2 era. We were just coming out of one of the greatest holiday seasons ever, with Sly 2, Burnout 3, Katamari Damacy, GTA: San Andreas, Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, Halo 2, and Half-Life 2 all being released in a four month period at the end of 2004. I don’t think anyone was expecting to have their minds blown so early in the new year, but Resident Evil 4 was something that surprised a lot of people.

The franchise, at that point, has seen a slew of spin-offs and prequels. Resident Evil Zero, Dead Aim, Outbreak, and Outbreak File #2 all weren’t exactly titles that met the quality of previous installments. Expectations were high, and they always are with numbered sequels to gigantic franchises, especially the size of Resident Evil. It had been (and still is) the flagship survival horror series, but I don’t think anyone was ready for how truly transcendent RE4 would be. It’s astonishing to think that God of War came out around then too; RE4 really was at the center of a golden age of video games, and I don’t think we’re bound for too many more of them to come.

Since RE6 is out, I thought it would be a good idea to not spend $60 and instead do a Resident Evil 4 Retrospective. Thankfully, there is an HD rerelease on Xbox Live, and like a lot of HD remasters I went in expecting nothing more than a fun look back at a game I love. I planned on playing for a day, maybe saying “it was better when I played it seven years ago”, and going on with my life. WRONG. Suffice it to say, Resident Evil 4 sucked me into its world, and never let go. I was shocked to see how well it held up over time, and it looked and played like any contemporary game on the market today. But what RE4 does better than anything else is how amazing the atmosphere is. From the second it starts, every single detail is meant to grab you and shake you to your core. There is a certain ambience that hasn’t been surpassed since, and the only thing that comes close to matching it has been Bioshock.

These changes reflect the continuing pattern both to broaden the discovery process and to encourage sanctions for failure to comply. Downer, 701 S.W.2d at 242. Indeed, use of sanctions are approved not only to assure compliance with the discovery process but also to deter those who might be tempted to abuse discovery in the absence of a deterrent.

Laura Jackson

Tuesday, 22 September 2015

As part of its 'Beyond Propaganda' series, the Legatum Institute hosted a panel discussion, chaired by Peter Pomerantsev, to launch a collection of papers that look at how 21st century warfare is changing and what can be done to react to information warfare.

Mark Laity, Chief of Strategic Communications at SHAPE, and Ben Nimmo, a prominent information warfare and defence analyst based in Scotland, were joined by Laura Jackson, a leading expert on the South China Sea and Chinese political-military strategy who has worked closely with the United States Secretary of Defense, to discuss their papers and the challenges posed to democratic governments by the current information war.

Laity first laid the groundwork of the debate by explaining the importance of narrative for national strategy. ‘If I want to persuade you to do something, I need to tap into your narrative’, he explained, before showing how Putin publically creates a powerful historical narrative around Ukraine for multiple distinct audiences. The panel then went on to discuss how pertinent the narratives of powers like Russia and China have become. Laity added that the Russians themselves describe their tactics as ‘information confrontation’ and that their approach ‘bridges peace and war’. Jackson claimed of the Chinese ‘They’re learning from Sun Tzu in terms of winning without fighting’, before adding that the holistic nature of China’s three-pronged non-kinetic warfare strategy makes it a new phenomenon, and that the artificial islands being built in the South China Sea are just the tip of the iceberg in China’s wider ambitions to manipulate the international order. Later in the discussion, Laity added that we have moved past the information age into the ‘engagement age’, and that profound shifts in technology pose new challenges for democratic governments.

Pomerantsev shifted the debate to how the democratic world can react to the new information war. Nimmo first identified where the power of disinformation lies, and used this as a starting point for building an effective",446,11, counter-narrative. He stated that ‘
221,0,27619,1025," gardening shears to her throat. He pulled her hair or slapped her while he raped her because he said she wasn't putting enough effort into it. Then he coerced her into silence by threatening to kill her children in Mexico or by reminding her of the power he had to fire her sister and brother, who also worked at the same farm. The supervisor knew that for workers not authorized to be in the country, the prospect of losing a job was almost as menacing as a death threat.

This case exemplified the phenomenon our reporting team was seeking to uncover: how immigration status and poverty are leveraged against female workers to hold them hostage in jobs where they are being sexually abused. Rosa's sister seemed too traumatized for us to approach directly, so Grace and I had decided to talk to Rosa first.

We parked the car and made our way into a grassy courtyard in search of the right apartment. We circled the complex and stopped at a door facing the street to check the number against our notes. This was it. We knocked.

The woman who answered had a broad face and high cheekbones. She still wore the jeans and fleece vest that she had put on before starting a shift at an egg production plant nearby. Grace and I introduced ourselves and told Rosa why we were there. She surveyed us warily. When we mentioned the name of the person who'd suggested we contact her, she reluctantly beckoned us inside.

We followed Rosa through the living room, which had been partitioned by curtains to create a third makeshift bedroom, and into the kitchen. Rosa was in the middle of making dinner, resuscitating leftover _mole_ sauce that a friend had given her. As the pot bubbled on the stove, we sat down at the table to get to know one another. Our conversation spanned the mundane to the meaningful: cooking techniques, her children, and her journey from Mexico through the desert to the United States. After a time, she insisted that we share in the meal. She had added chicken to the sauce, which was rich and hearty.

Before the end of the evening, Rosa agreed to speak with us about what had happened to both her and her sister at the farm where they had worked. Like many of the women we encountered, she said she wanted to bring attention to an untenable problem and hoped that by doing so, she would help other women.

But as we talked, a thought occurred to her. Before she agreed to a recorded interview for possible radio and television broadcast, she had some questions. How would taking such a public stance affect her job? More important, what if the supervisor who had raped her sister found out and decided to retaliate against them? She added that she had run into him just the week before at a _quinceañera_ and he'd given her a dirty look. Before that, she had spotted him at the local Walmart.

Grace and I didn't have any answers for Rosa, and we told her so. In fact, as reporters, we could promise her little except the possibility of protecting her identity and telling her story with fidelity. We suggested that she talk to someone who she trusted about whether she should agree to continue speaking with us or not. About a week later, we got word that despite her altruistic impulses, Rosa had decided not to proceed.

It was easy for us to understand why. On our third and last visit with Rosa, she had taken us into her bedroom, packed with cleaning supplies and beauty products. There, standing next to her bed, she pulled out her phone to show us pictures of her two teenage kids. She had left them with her mother eight years ago when she had come to America in search of work to support them. In the way that her smile widened at their image, it was clear: her kids and her ability to provide for them were the sun around which she revolved.

When Rosa and everyone else in her situation are asked to make it publicly known that they've been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted, the stakes for them are impossibly high. The potential collective good is weighed against what is immediately and urgently necessary. Because there is no assurance that speaking out will be met with protection from future or collateral harm, the only rational thing to do is to say nothing. After meeting Rosa, I came to understand why so many sexually abused workers have for so long abided in silence.

Grace and I had gone looking for Rosa in the fall of 2012, but the effort to uncover the stories of women farmworkers who had been sexually abused on the job had begun several years before. It had started with Linsay Rousseau Burnett, a journalism graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley who had taken an internship at a national television network in the summer of 2009. She had been",987,11," tasked with reporting on child farm labor, and it was"

When most people consider getting a new pet, their thoughts turn to a cute bundle of fluff; a baby to join the family and grow up as part of it. Certainly a puppy or kitten will provide hours of entertainment but they can also be a lot of hard work. Just like a human baby they don't come fully house trained and many won't sleep through the night for some time! Many people underestimate the amount of attention and time a young animal needs and so they are not ideal for everyone.

Effective shipbuilding will require a close partnership between government and industry, according to Vice Adm. Marty Chanik, USN (Ret.), vice president of business development for Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding. Adm. Chanik cited serial production as the best way to maximize quality and cost savings for major shipbuilding programs. The admiral emphasized the need for a strong shipbuilding base working closely with government. He called for an incentive program for capital investment, predicting a greater return if improvements are realized over the length of a program.

Airpower has been at the core of Navy power projection since World War II, but new concepts are forcing the sea service to take another look at how to use it. A panel focusing on the air-sea battle concept drew diverse conclusions about the future of ocean airpower. One point is that the United States may need an entirely new generation of warfighting aircraft, both manned and unmanned, to wage successful combat against future adversaries. Even the best existing and planned combat aircraft may not meet those needs.

Rear Adm. Jim Bebee, USN (Ret.), executive director, commander, Naval Air Forces, warned that the atrophying of the industrial base for legacy systems",280,11, means that the United States must move into the next generation

Rosewood Scrub Historical Society Building is a heritage-listed former shire hall at 73 Edmond Street, Marburg, City of Ipswich, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1913 by Anton Jendrachowski. It is also known as Rosewood Shire Council Branch Office, Rosewood Shire Council Office, and Walloon Shire Council Office & Meeting Hall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.

History 
This small timber building was erected in mid-1913 as offices and meeting place for the Walloon Shire Council.

Although the town of Walloon (on the Ipswich-Granchester railway line) was established in the 1860s, Marburg, established in the late 1870s in the centre of the Rosewood Scrub district, proved the natural administrative centre for local government. The Walloon Divisional Board, proclaimed in 1879, initially met at the Plains paddock, then at Woodlands (TL Smith's Marburg residence), and then at premises in Marburg. In 1903 the Walloon Divisional Board became the Walloon Shire Council.

In 1912 the council, whose",248,11," Marburg office was considered beyond repair, petitioned the"

We call a set $C\subseteq \overline{\Omega}$ Cheeger set of $\Omega$, if $\displaystyle\frac{|\partial C|}{|C|}=h(\Omega)$. For more about the uniqueness and regularity, we refer to [@11]. Cheeger sets are of significant importance in the modelling of landslides, see [@24],[@25], or in fracture mechanics, see [@26].

The classical Cheeger’s inequality is about the first eigenvalue of Laplacian and the Cheeger constant(c.f.[@3]) $$\lambda_{1}(2,\Omega)\geq \bigg(\frac{h(\Omega)}{2}\bigg)^2\quad\mbox{i.e.}\quad h(\Omega)\leq 2\sqrt{\lambda_{1}(2,\Omega)},$$ which was extent to the $p$-Laplacian in [@12]: $$\lambda_{1}(p,\Omega)\geq \bigg(\frac{h(\Omega)}{p}\bigg)^p.$$ When $p=1$, the first eigenvalue of $1$-Laplacian is defined by $$\label{1-laplace}
\lambda_{1}(1,\Omega):=\min_{0\not=u\in BV(\Omega)}\displaystyle\frac{\int_{\Omega}|Du|+\int_{\partial\Omega}|u|d\mathcal{H}^{n-1}}{\int_{\Omega}|u|dx},$$ where $BV(\Omega)$ denotes the space of functions of bounded variation in $\Omega$. From [@3], $\lambda_{1}(1,\Omega)=h(\Omega)$. And, problem (\[cheeger inequality\]) and problem (\[1-laplace\]) are equivalent in the following sense: a function $u\in BV(\Omega)$ is a minimum of (\[1-laplace\]) if and only if almost every level set is a Cheeger set. An important difference between $\lambda_1(p,\Omega)$ and $h_k(\Omega)$ is that the first eigenfunction of $p$-Laplacian is unique while the uniqueness of Cheeger set depends on the topology of the domain. For counterexamples, see [@4 Remark 3.13]. For more results about the eigenvalues of 1-Laplacian, we refer to [@6] and [@7].

As to the more general Lipschitz domain, we need the following definition of perimeter: $$P_{\Omega}(E):=\sup\bigg{\{}\int_E \mbox{div}\phi dx\bigg{|} \phi\in C^1_c(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n), |\phi|\leq 1, \mbox{div} \phi\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)\bigg{\}}.$$ For convenience, we denote $|\partial E|:=P_{\Omega}(E)$. The higher order Cheeger’s constant is defined by $$h_k(\Omega):=\inf\{\lambda\in \mathbb{R}^+|\exists \ E_1,E_2,\cdots,E_k\subseteq \Omega, E_i\cap E_j=\emptyset,\mbox{µ±}i\not=j,\max_{1,2,\cdots,k}\frac{|\partial E_i|}{|E_i|}\le",896,11,q \lambda \};$$ if$|E|

A package typically has a substrate portion that the chip is electrically connected to. Usually the substrate is larger than the chip and has a larger array of leads or electrical contact points than that of the chip to allow for ease of assembly of the packaged chip onto a circuit board. One such package configuration is a flip-chip package.
An example of a conventional flip-chip package 20 is shown in FIG. 1. In this example, the chip 22 is electrically connected to the substrate 24 by an array of solder bumps 26. The substrate 24 in this example has an array of solder balls 28 (i.e., ball grid array or BGA), which may be used to attach the packaged chip 20 to a circuit board (not shown), for example. Typically, an underfill material 30 is fed into the free space or gap between the chip 22 and the substrate 24 after the chip 22 is electrically connected to the substrate 24 via the solder bumps 26.

King chimed in once more, giving Omar yet another opportunity to express remorse or possibly apologize. She inquired as to whether or not the lawmaker would like to make it “clear that you’re not anti-Semitic.”

Republican National Convention

June 10, 1936

In this room rests the greatest responsibility that has come to a body of Americans
in three generations. In the lesser sense this is a convention of a great political
party. But in the larger sense it is a convention of Americans to determine the fate
of those ideals for which this nation was founded. That far transcends all partisanship.

There are elemental currents which make or break the fate of nations. There is a
moral purpose in the universe. Those forces which affect the vitality",331,11," and the soul

231,0,29851,2050," another citizenship. Before 1948 that rule only applied to male Italian parents.

Now, retroactively, the Italian Supreme Court has held that the same rule applies to women who had previously lost their citizenship through marriage before 1948 -- and to their descendants, through their own bloodline.

Now, not only have they been retroactively ""re-granted"" their lost citizenship, but the rule that they automatically pass on this ""latent"" (or ""unrecognized"") citizenship to their children, directly through the maternal line, also applies.

As I understand it, the citizenship is ""latent"" because whether or not the descendant knows he/she has it, or whether or not they have a passport, the Italian government will automatically recognize it, if it is applied for.

Also, by extension, a holder of latent Italian citizenship passes on his/her citizenship exactly as does a holder of an ""active"" one -- whether or not that person's descendants are aware of it. So now, all children even of *latent* Italian citizens are de jure Italian citizens, regardless of whether the latent citizenship holder is male or female, or if their right to citizenship was previously cut off by marriage somewhere in their ancestry.

The logical consequence of this is that, barring an overt renunciation of Italian citizenship by anyone in the chain, all future descendants, down the line and looking back on either parents' side any number of generations (at least from the founding of the modern Italian Republic), are latent Italian citizens.

By the way, it seems that this decision clearly invalidates the part of the 1912 law that prevented women married to foreigners from passing on their citizenship. It basically voids the consequences of that law for all of their descendants looking forward, and also effectively nullifies it for all descendants of such women looking backward, from the founding of the Italian Republic.

Please forgive me if I'm re-hashing stuff about unrecognized citizenship that I've seen has already been discussed on these boards. I'm just connecting the dots, partly for my own understanding here, and partly to maybe help anyone who doesn't yet see it.

Yes, it is a bit of a rehash. Feel free though if it's helping you understand the Cassazione court ruling.

The Cassazione court ruling does not state that a female Italian citizen (whether she married a foreign spouse or not) passes citizenship to children born prior to 1948 however. There's a law that's been stalled in committee in parliament for a few years that would make that change, but it's never come up for a vote.

I think, Joe, that you are expanding the stated intent of the ruling. Before 1948, women married to foreign nationals lost Italian citizenship and thus the ability to pass citizenship to their children. Should the ruling be adopted as law, women in this situation would be recognized as having maintained their Italian status and thus the ability to pass on citizenship to their children born after 1948. Unfortunately, as teddi notes, the ability to pass citizenship to children born before 1948 is a separate issue which is not addressed in this ruling.

The bill that has been stalled in committee would change this to allow those born before 1948 to inherit citizenship through the maternal line. It would also simplify reinstatement of citizenship for Italians who naturalized before 1992. Unfortunately, the proposal comes from a minority party, and, therefore, has obtained little support to date.

The inability of children born of Italian women married to foreigners before '48 to gain Italian citizenship was, as I see it, a direct consequence of the 1912 law.

If you invalidate that law, or a section of that law, as the Cassazione court did, I think that the consequences of the law simply disappear. They cease to have any effect.

Pardon me for being a bit outspoken for an upstart novice here. I'm an American business attorney who knows little about immigration law, Italian or American.

But the way I see it, when a high court invalidates a law, or part of a law, any legal consequence of what was invalidated, disappears in a puff of smoke.

The bill stalled in committee would have had the EXACT same practical effect, but what has apparently happened here is that the Cassazione bypassed the legislative branch by declaring that part of the 1912 law unconstitutional.

I also don't think the bill in committee and the ruling were unrelated; the same interest groups and controversies probably drove both. What the legislature was unwilling to do, the court did.

To teddi: I have absolutely no difficulty interpreting the Cassazione ruling. What I meant is that since I've just started delving into the world of Italian citizenship law, I've been fl",986,11,ustered wrapping my head around all the various interpretations and

In the process, the effacement of any symbolization that would refer to the old nationalism has become a necessity. And in the process of exchange, it expects to produce a subject which is also open to this. Cinema, in this sense, become paradoxical in its operation as apparatus: what is to be represented (since cinema mostly functions through representation and suggestion) if it aims for less symbolization? If it is the ""traditional"" notion of the nation that will be erased from representation, if not, ""nationalism"" itself, what then is to be done with cinema? It needs to have another object – another ideology – to represent. This was resolved by a new sub-genre in romantic comedy, which is hugot. The word literally means ""to pull-out,"" which in this context, a hugot in literary sense is a recontextualization of a certain passage or sentence which is pulled-out of personal reference In an earlier study I made, I identified the way of which hugot films succeeds on reproducing ideology through the repetition of the dialogues uttered by the 19 Karatani, Nation and Aesthetics, 22. 141 J.

Board of Directors Meetings Procedure

The Board of Directors Meetings Procedure describes how to properly plan, execute, and record Board of Director’s Meetings. The procedure applies to Top Management who oversees the meeting process and “The Board” who is responsible for attending such meetings and making decisions regarding the company’s operations as required.

(8 pages, 1654 words)

In order to prepare for the Board of Director’s meetings, you should know they will be scheduled and held in accordance with the company’s bylaws. The Board should meet at least once a year. Directors should receive notice at least ten days prior to these meetings. Such notice should include: the date, time, and place of the meeting; meeting agenda; and in the case of a special (i.e., unscheduled) meeting, who is calling the meeting and why.

During February 27--September 30, 2015, a total of 12,126 alerts were reported through CEBS in 9 Sierra Leone districts ([Figure 2](#F2){ref-type=""fig""}). Tonkolili was the first district to report on a consistent basis, beginning on February 27, followed by Moyamba (March 6), Pujehun (March 14), Kenema (March 31), Kambia (April 13), Bo (April 18), Kono (April 23), Bombali (April 27), and Kailahun (June 14). From June 14 onward, the districts were collectively reporting an average of 79 alerts per day.

In regard to the aforementioned change or development in controlling legal principles or change in the legal atmosphere it has been stated that these standards do not mean that the earlier decision must have been overruled or that the second ruling be inconsistent with the first. The above italicized language means rather that the ""second court should be freed from the prior determination if there has been some marked advance or alteration in relevant orientation, approach, reasoning, or principles."" Hercules Powder Co. v. United States, 337 F.2d 643, 648, 167 Ct.Cl. 639, 649 (1964) (dissenting opinion). That such a marked alteration in approach to the problem at hand exists is evidenced by the recent decision of this court in Tidewater Oil Company v. United States, 339 F.2d 633, 168 Ct.Cl. 457 (1964). We held in Tidewater that transferors of oil ""allowables""2 in the East Texas Oil Field, who received royalties on each barrel of oil produced under the transferred allowables, did not have the requisite interest in the oil in place to enable them to qualify for depletion allowances. A comparison of the reasoning and approach used in the first CBN case and the Tidewater case lucidly underscores the change of course in our approach to depletion matters.

A bothersome point in the prior CBN case was the lack of a fee or leasehold interest by plaintiff in the oil-producing properties. Placing reliance on Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., 350 U.S. 308, 76 S.Ct. 395, 100 L.Ed. 347 (1956), this Court stated at 328 F.2d 322, 164 Ct.Cl. 550: ""It is not necessary that the holder of an economic interest have title to the property.""

""The current version of the wellness initiative rolled out by PSU [Penn State University] with Highmark Blueshield, WebMD and ICH [Integrated Corporate Health] is an invasion of privacy. The wellness survey questions are not posted anywhere for member evaluation before participation. The only way to evaluate the survey questions is by creating a WebMD account. When you create this WebMD account, it is VERY, VERY important to read the terms and conditions -- because you are giving WebMD immediate access to ALL your medical diagnosis and records. Later, when you sign into your Highmark account after creating this WebMD account, clicking'rewards' automatically downloads all your medical records from Highmark to WebMD, without providing any warning about this data transfer. This includes all doctor diagnoses!!"" -- N. Krishnan Kutty STATE COLLEGE, PA

""First, this is a serious intrusion into my privacy without me being proper informed. Second, any wellness program should encourage and reward people for participating in it not to punish them. Third, the questionnaire is intrusive, with many questions being confusing, misleading or simply improper. The numbers and recommendations are very general and essentially uninformative and I have to do all this only to receive this unsolicited and unnecessary information. I do my wellness program under the guidance of my doctor and everything I did to avoid penalty was complete waist of time and completely meaningless."" -- Yakov Pesin STATE COLLEGE, PA

""I completed the questionnaire and was amazed and appalled by the questions asked and the results ('health profile') I received after completing this questionnaire. I perceive it as a gross violation of my privacy and offend to my feelings. Rather than 'think about my health', as one of the last questions suggested, it made me feel first humiliated then angry."" -- Irina Mikaelian UNIVERSITY PARK, PA

246,0,20479,0,"Power BI mobile apps feature summary – December 2016

Just before 2016 wraps up, we're happy to introduce the latest update for Power BI mobile apps! Within this update, you'll find new capabilities such as the ability to share an annotated report, and geo filtering for reports on Android devices. You will also find improvements to existing features, such as visuals links, Apple watch integration and offline background refresh adjustment to reduce cellular data consumption.

It’s been a great year for Power BI Mobile, and we would like to thank you for providing valuable feedback and encourage you to keep posting in Power BI Community. We look forward to bringing you even more excellent new and improved features in 2017!

Share insights instantly with new and improved Annotate and Share (iOS)

The ability to annotate and share a tile’s snapshots has been available on iOS devices since day one. By adding inking, text, or symbols to a snapshot of any dashboard tile, you emphasize an insight or call for action on a specific metric and share it easily with your colleagues. You can share your annotated snapshot over email, text, or any other social app you have on your device. With this update, we have improved the menu and user experience to make it even easier and quicker to annotate and share.

But wait, there's more! You can now also share an annotated report or mobile-optimized report directly from your Power BI app. For mobile-optimized reports, you can also choose to annotate and share a single visual from the visual in focus.

In addition to the above, when you share a snapshot via email we will also generate a deep link to the tile or report. When your colleague receives your email, they can continue their exploration in Power BI by clicking the link and landing directly into the latest view of the tile (assuming they have permission to access it). If the link is clicked on with a mobile device, we will open the tile directly on their Power BI mobile app. Read more about the new and improved annotate and share in our documentation.

Request access to dashboards directly from your mobile app (iOS)

Power BI QR codes are a great way to spread Power BI in your organization because you can place them in a central place where colleagues can scan them and get quick access to a specific and important metric. However, only users with access to the tile’s QR dashboard can scan the QR using the Power BI mobile app and instantly see the tile. For those who scan a QR and don’t have access to the original dashboard, they can now submit a request for access directly from their mobile app. This request will be sent to the dashboard owner. Once the dashboard owner approves the share request in Power BI web portal, the user can scan the QR and access the data. The user who submitted the request will be notified about their access through a push notification in the mobile app.

Android Tablet preview

In case you missed it this month we released a preview of our new Android tablet app. Bringing this app to preview first enables you to help us shape this product to perfection. Please download the app today, and join the conversation in the Power BI Mobile community forum.

Geographic filtering (Android)

Earlier this year we introduced the ability to filter reports based on your current location on iOS app. We are happy to bring this capability to Android. Now you can use your Android device to filter reports by your current location in just one tap. When viewing reports with data about the city, state, or country that you’re in, you’ll be able to filter your data by that city, state, or country. As long you’re using the app, the filter will remain in effect in the reports to which it was applied. See only the data you need! For more about geographic filtering, see our documentation.

Report after filtering

Apple watch improvements (iOS)

You can now refresh Apple Watch data directly from the Watch app. In the dashboard index page, deep press to refresh your data. (note that the Power BI iPhone app must be running in the background on your iPhone for this to work).

Custom URL on image tile (iOS, Android)

We have changed the behavior that occurs when tapping on tiles that contain custom URLs on iOS devices. If an image tile has a custom URL defined by the dashboard owner, when you tap the tile you go directly to that URL without opening the tile in focus mode. Also, on Android, dashboard tiles containing predefined custom URLs are now able to redirect users to reports within the app.

Offline background refresh adjustments (All)

To make sure you can access your latest data while offline, we perform a refresh in the background of the app that ensures your business information will be up to date, even if you haven’t accessed it for",1022,11, a while. We have made a change in this process

Economic Policy
Diversifying the economy away from oil revenues, which accounted for $26.1 billion of the government’s $29.9 billion of revenue in 2012, should be a major economic priority for Bahrain, writes Your Middle East’s Public Finance analyst Bassam Aoun.

The situation in Bahrain is a matter of perspective. Socially, the Kingdom has been in the midst of a historical shift in its political dynamic. Sporadic protests against Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa’s rule, which has been uncontested for 41 years, have thrust this small but divided nation into a state of political flux. Reforms have been discussed, talks have been held, and promises have been made. Underneath the surface, however, these efforts have been criticized as unsubstantial – talks have lacked any significant presence of the ruling family and opposition members remain steadfast in their decision not to concede any of their demands, mostly in fear of appearing anything less than determined to contest monarchy loyalists.

Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, the crown prince and heir apparent of the Bahraini monarchy, has attempted to diffuse tensions by taking on a proactively reformist role in the exchanges between opposition members and loyalists, all while struggling to maintain several sectors of the economy. Both sides, nevertheless, remain intransigent in their approach to compromise. Evidently, the sociopolitical perspective is still a work in progress.

Protests are ongoing and regularly test the nation’s economic standing by pushing it further to the brink.

At the moment, the political outlook seems dismal, but the economic outlook for the Kingdom, however, is a mixed review. Some sectors have surely been battered by the current situation; tourism, for example, is under pressure due to the demonstrations, which have at times ended in violence. International events, such as the Formula One Grand Prix, have come under scrutiny and have been labeled by opposition supporters as an excuse for the monarchy to fake its legitimacy. The tourism industry is of the essence to the Kingdom’s economic vision, and will require additional attention in the near term.

Public debt is another issue that is going to be on policymakers’ agendas soon. The figure is currently at 35.7% of GDP, according to recent International Monetary Fund consultations with the Kingdom,",496,11, and is headed for 61% by 2018. The budget

He can’t be sure if it was the sound of his car’s windows shattering in the heat of the blaze that woke him up, or maybe the flickering orange glow which suddenly illuminated his room.

Whatever it was, it most probably saved his life.

Kocak, an eloquent man of Turkish descent, recalls how he rushed to the window and saw that his car parked in the garage next to the house was on fire.

It was then, he says, that he put two and two together and shouted for his parents to wake up.

""I immediately knew it was a right-wing attack. There was no question about that.""

Arson attacks target activists

What makes Kocak, who works in marketing for a private university in Berlin and is involved in local politics for the Left Party, so certain is the fact that the arson attack is just one of many that have hit Berlin’s Neukölln neighborhood in recent months.

On the same night, the car of a man who runs a left-wing bookshop in Neukölln also went up in flames.

Kocak says his mother suffered a heart attack due to all the stress caused by the attack

Tourists flock to this district known for its trendy bars, cafes and a cuisine as varied as its inhabitants, a mix of students, expats and Germans whose parents moved here from Turkey and the Middle East.

But there are some, it seems, who are less enamored with its multicultural appeal: Beginning in 2016, Neukölln has been rocked by a series of arson attacks, broken windows and racist slogans smeared on walls targeting those who dare to speak up against right-wing extremism or openly support refugees. Sometimes, refusing a flyer handed out by activists from the right-wing NPD party can be enough to trigger a violent response.

Slogan target activists at their homes

Photos provided by activists show slogans painted on walls denouncing those living there as ""red swine"" or ""lefty rat.""

According to ReachOut, a local NGO that monitors right-wing, anti-Semitic and racist attacks and supports the victims, some 38 attacks occurred in Neukölln in 2016, 36 in 2017. Earlier this year, the district’s parliament passed a resolution asking the police to label the attacks as ""terror.""

But even without the label, the violence is sending a chilling message to local activists.

Ferat Kocak, for one, told DW he wasn't at all surprised when the arson attack occurred. In a way, he’d been expecting it.

He’s involved in local politics and went to a kick-off meeting for a left-wing alliance in Neukölln. He’s also outspoken on Facebook, with public posts such as ""Get Nazis out of the minds.""

Who’s behind the attacks?

Talk to victims and local activists and they all point to a small group of right-wing extremists, and in particular two members of the local National Democratic Party (NPD) party. After all, they say, it requires an extensive knowledge of the neighborhood to commit such crimes, such as observing where activists park their cars and pinpointing people engaged in local activism.

The National Democratic Party is seen as Germany’s most extremist active far-right party with a wing which traditionally espouses violence.

NPD members protesting against a refugee center in Berlin (archive)

The NPD, however, failed the five percent hurdle in the last general elections needed to enter parliament. Last year, an attempt to ban the party failed when Germany’s Constitutional Court ruled that the NPD had anti-constitutional objectives, but did not have the political clout to undermine German democracy.

The last interview I ever did and will ever do was with a newspaper journalist. I was trying to get a little free publicity for a commercial endeavor. The dude misquoted me horribly. He said that I said and actually put in quotes all kinds of things I never said, at all – not even close. Fortunately for me, this was relatively harmless, but imagine if it was something serious (sex assault or massive police corruption, for example)! I’d seriously recommend that anyone think twice before ever talking to either a journalist or a cop. Odds are it’s probably a very dangerous mistake!

Rolling Stone blamed Jackie (the alleged victim), but the only mistake I can see that she made was trusting a journalist with anything. Now, her name – or the name of some woman or women – at UVA are being doxxed and smeared all over the internet by some misogynist dude. (Yeah, I know, that’s pretty much a redundancy, it looks like.)

This story gets worse as I read deeper. Apparently, Jackie, at one point, became overwhelmed with the idea of having the story go public, even anonymously – which is completely understandable. The journalist wouldn’t let her out of the story, but proceeded without her permission. Jackie also wanted to be able to fact check her part of the story about campus rape, but the Rolling Stoner appears to have gone ahead with the story without any regard to her wishes",353,11, or her will being and without any fact checking on Jackie

When Ava stumbles into Paradise and comes face-to-face with her dream man, she has a feeling she’s standing on the precipice of something life-changing. Not to mention, she couldn’t be more surprised to learn her supposedly prim and proper aunt Julie was actually part owner of the premier sex club in Miami and a top-notch Dominatrix.

Navy SEAL Logan Turner always knew he needed more out of life than the next mission. That’s why he opened Paradise with his best friend Julie. It didn’t hurt that he could reap the benefits of owning a BDSM sex club. But when a sexy, doe-eyed woman walks in, his control slips for the first time ever.

Maggie's Longing

Who would have thought a plan to get the attention of one man, would have Maggie Blake taking two men to her bed?

Maggie Blake has one desire, to experience what the way too sexy Brian O'Malley has to offer in bed. Too bad he thinks of her as an annoyance and not as the hot, willing woman she is.

Brian O'Malley has one rule in life. Never let a woman too close, but club Paradise's sassy little bartender threatens to change that rule and wiggle her hot little ass into his damaged heart.

Julie's Surrender

Mistress Julie has worked to gain control of her life and overcome a tragedy from her past, and as a co-owner of Paradise, Miami’s premier BDSM club, she thought she had everything. But the truth is she longs for something more—something like the happiness her closest friends have found with their new partners.

Nick’s sexual specialty is playing “guest star” as the third in his friends’ ménage encounters. He’s especially good at reading a situation and adjusting accordingly, and giving and receiving pleasure—and then moving on. But once he meets Julie, Nick begins to rethink his ideas on relationships.

Nick and Julie get along great outside the bedroom, but Nick will need all his skills at discerning a woman’s deepest desires to show Julie that what she thinks she wants isn’t exactly what she needs.

Logan Turner walked into Paradise. The smell of booze and sex flowed over him, comforting his raw nerves. He scanned the large space and noticed the paint changes and new furnishings. The last time Logan was home, he and his business partner, Julie, discussed the updates this place needed. He liked the contrast of red paint and black leather furniture.

His gaze landed on the pretty little bartender and club manager. Her small, heart-shaped ass wiggled to whatever music beat through her earbuds.

“Hey, Maggie, I like what you did with the place,” he called out, loud enough for her to hear him.

The glass she washed clattered into the sink and Maggie spun. The look of surprise on her attractive face had Logan biting back a chuckle.

“Oh, Logan, you scared me.”

She wiped her palms on a bar rag, pushed her pink bangs out of her eyes and rushed over to him. He enveloped her fairy-sized body into a friendly hug.

Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia’s former Deputy Prime Minister, is back in Australia to deliver lectures in Canberra, Melbourne and other Australian cities.

I was fortunate enough to see him speak during a visit in early 2005. My thoughts on that visit can be found here.

Since that time, I’ve had the benefit of visiting Malaysia as part of a delegation sponsored by the Australia-Malaysia Institute. Our delegation met with people across the cultural and political spectrum. Many continue to speak warmly of Anwar, while others (generally UMNO activists) tow the party line.

Hopefully, I’ll get a chance in the coming weeks to share with readers notes I took during meetings with both Anwar supporters and detractors. Suffice it to say that Anwar still seems to exercise considerable support from young educated Malays and from members of Malaysia’s minority communities (particularly Indian Muslims).

In the meantime, Anwar’s current visit provides me with a good excuse to provide some highlights from his previous visit.

On one occasion, I was fortunate enough to attend a dinner hosted by Dr Abdul Rahim Ghouse, the current CEO of the Muslim Community Co-Operative (Australia) Limited (MCCA), a close friend and former campaign manager for Anwar.

In introducing his old friend, Dr Ghouse highlighted Anwar’s ability of bringing otherwise opposite sides together. He described how Anwar’s release saw a rare discussion between the ambassadors to Australia of both Iran and the United States to share thoughts on what this might mean for relations between the West and the Muslim world.

Dr Ghouse mentioned that Professor John Esposito, a prominent American author, commentator and expert on Muslim affairs, listed Anwar as one of the top 9 makers of contemporary Islam, both as an activist and an intellectual.

Anwar spoke at some length during the dinner. The notes I took of his speech at the time can be summarised as follows:

[01] Anwar was first arrested on 20 September 2998. At the time, the Malaysian government tried to send a message to the world that Malaysians had all but forgotten about Anwar, that he was deemed irrelevant to the Malaysian political scene. But Anwar and his family soon learnt that people of goodwill from the outside world, both Malays and non-Malays, didn’t want to forget him.

[02] Anwar quoted from historian Arnold Toynbee about the past achievements of the Islamic world. He said that this was history, and that the Muslims’ present was hardly something worth boasting about. Anwar said that the Muslim world at the moment was at the lowest ebb of its history. Its political and economic position has never been so low.

[03] In facing and addressing the rot in the Muslim world, Anwar said that Muslims shouldn’t blame Europe or the United States. Instead, Muslims need to act to place their own house",627,11," in order.

A:

You've fallen for the trap of believing that a pointer and an array are the same thing.  They are not.
A string, by convention in C, is normally represented as an array of char, with an additional terminator of '\0' (the so-called nul-character) appended on the end.   So the string literal ""AB"" is represented as an array of three char with values 'A', 'B', and '\0'.
A pointer is completely different from an array and, since a string is represented using an array of char, a pointer and a string are completely separate things.   A pointer is a variable that contains an address in memory.
Where things get confused is the name of an array is, in a number of contexts, converted into a pointer.  For example;
 char x[] = ""AB"";
 char *p = x;

This assignment works, but that doesn't mean an array is a pointer, or a pointer is an array.   Instead, the name x is converted into a pointer to its first character.   So the initialisation is functionally equivalent to
 char *p = &x[0];

so p points to the character with value 'A' in the string",709,11," ""AB"".

260,0,20490,0,"Unlike other tissues which can survive extended periods of hypoxia, brain tissue is particularly sensitive to deprivation of oxygen or energy. Permanent damage to neurons can occur during brief periods of hypoxia, anoxia or ischemia. Neurotoxic injury is known to be caused or accelerated by certain excitatory amino acids (RAA) found naturally in the central nervous system (CNS). Glutamate (Glu) is an endogenous amino acid which has been characterized as a fast excitatory transmitter in the mammalian brain. Glutamate is also known as a powerful neurotoxin capable of killing CNS neurons under certain pathological conditions which accompany stroke and cardiac arrest. Normal glutamate concentrations are maintained within brain tissue by energy-consuming transport systems. Under low energy conditions which occur during conditions of hypoglycemia, hypoxia or ischemia, cells can release glutamate. Under such low energy conditions the cell is not able to take glutamate back into the cell. Initial glutamate release stimulates further release of glutamate which results in an extracellular glutamate accumulation and a cascade of neurotoxic injury.
It has been shown that the sensitivity of central neurons to hypoxia and ischemia can be reduced by either blockage of synaptic transmission or by the specific antagonism of postsynaptic glutamate receptors [see S. M. Rothman and J. W. Olney, ""Glutamate and the Pathophysiology of Hypoxia-Ischemic Brain Damage,"" Annals of Neurology, 19 No. 2 (1986)]. Glutamate is characterized as a broad spectrum agonist having activity at three neuronal excitatory amino acid receptor sites. These receptor sites are named after the amino acids which selectively excite them, namely: Kainate (KA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA or NMA) and quisqualate (QUIS).
Neurons which have EAA receptors on their dendritic or somal surfaces undergo acute excitotoxic degeneration when these receptors are excessively activated by glutamate. Thus, agents which selectively block or antagonize the action of glutamate at the EAA synaptic receptors of central neurons can prevent neurotoxic injury associated with hypoxia, anoxia, or ischemia caused by stroke, cardiac arrest or perinatal asphyxia.
It is known that compounds of various structures, such as aminophosphonovalerate derivatives and piperidine dicarboxylate derivatives, may act as competitive antagonists at the NMDA receptor. Certain piperidineethanol derivatives, such as ifenprodil and 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-piperidinyl]ethanol, which are known anti-ischemic agents, have been found to be non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists [C. Carter et al, J. Pharm Exp. Ther, 247 (3), 1222-1232 (1988)].

Thomas led the joint armies again in 1644, taking Santya and Asti; he also tried to take Finale Ligure, but gave up the attempt, apparently because he feared this valuable port would end up in French control rather than Piedmontese. In 1645, now commanding with Du Plessis Praslin, he took Vigevano, and repulsed a Spanish attempt to block his withdrawal at the River Mora, the nearest he ever came to a success in the field. In 1646, Thomas was put in command of the French expedition sent south to take the Tuscan forts, after which he was to advance further south to Naples, drive out the Spanish and put himself on the throne of the kingdom; but the expedition set off late, and when he besieged Orbetello, the supporting French fleet was defeated by the Spanish and he was forced to raise the siege and conduct a difficult retreat, which he performed so poorly that Cardinal Mazarin subsequently despised his command ability, viewed him as incompetent, and declined to appoint him to the expedition that France sent to support the Naples revolt late in 1647 (this did not stop Mazarin from considering him as a potential candidate for a French-backed King of Naples, though Paris was so slow to move on this that Henry II, Duke of Guise was adopted by the Neapolitans instead). In the 1647 campaign, Thomas is mentioned as commanding alongside the French general in the forces sent across north Italy to work with the Duke of Modena Francesco I d'Este who had just allied with France and opened up a'second front' against the Spaniards in Milan, though Mazarin confessed that he had appointed Thomas only because he feared that, if left behind in Piedmont, the Prince's restless spirit would make more trouble. By spring of 1648 however he was back in Piedmont, fighting on the Piedmont-Milan border to distract the Spanish from their pressure on Modena; in the summer, he was put in charge of an army sent on a fleet to Naples - the Naples revolt had already collapsed by then, so the expedition found no support when it landed and after some pointless actions it re-embarked, a complete failure (some details in Naples revolt). On his return with the French fleet, Thomas was delayed in Provence and unable to join the great siege of Cremona where",529,11," he was expected.

To confirm the effect of TLR3 and TLR4 molecules on patterns of leukocyte accumulation within the CNS, histological and confocal examinations were performed. Histological examination revealed that increased BBB permeability in JEV-infected TLR3^−/−^ mice was associated with perivascular cuffing, while JEV infection of TLR4^−/−^ mice elicited reduced numbers of infiltrating foci ([**Figure 2E**](#ppat-1004319-g002){ref-type=""fig""}). Similarly, significantly higher numbers of infiltrated CD11b^+^ cells were detected in TLR3^−/−^ mice by confocal microscopy, and a small subset of CD11b^+^ myeloid cells co-stained positive with JEV antigen ([**Figure 2F**](#ppat-1004319-g002){ref-type=""fig""}). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TLR3-induced signal pathway is essential for the control of neuroinflammation caused by JEV infection, while TLR4 molecules may be dispensable to provide resistance to fatal encephalitis.

In terms of severe neuroinflammation in TLR3^−/−^ mice, the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines within the CNS can be required for further explain encephalitis, because encephalitis caused by neurotrophic viruses is indirectly derived from CNS degeneration caused by robust immunological responses, such as the uncontrolled secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and resultant activation of microglia and astrocytes [@ppat.1004319-Ghosh1]--[@ppat.1004319-Ghoshal1]. Therefore, we examined the expression of cytokines and chemokines in inflammatory tissues. We found that JEV infection of TLR3^−/−^ mice induced a highly enhanced expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in the CNS, including brain and spinal cord, whereas moderate changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in TLR4^−/−^ mice ([**Figure 3A and B**](#ppat-1004319-g003){ref-type=""fig""}).

265,0,22707,1025,"inated ground water falls into the two broad categories of aerobic and anaerobic bioremediation. The aerobic processes, regardless of whether they are carried out in situ or in a bioreactor, require addition of (1) oxygen as the electron acceptor for catabolism of the halogenated solvents, and (2) a carbon source, such as methane, propane, phenol, toluene, or butane. The utilization of an appropriate carbon source induces an enzyme that fortuitously degrades many halogenated solvents, but without any immediate benefit to the microorganisms involved. This process has been applied in situ to aqueous contamination in several instances, and at least one patent has been granted for this approach (U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,048). It has also been used to treat aqueous contamination in above-ground bioreactors with numerous variations, especially using proprietary microorganisms and nutrient mixes. Many patents have been granted in this area, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,057,221; 5,962,305; 5,945,331.
Anaerobic bioremediation of halogenated solvents is a fundamentally different process than aerobic bioremediation. Under appropriate anaerobic conditions, chlorinated solvents can be used directly by some microorganisms as electron acceptors through a process that has come to be known as “chlororespiration,” or, more generally, “halorespiration.” D. L. Freedman & J. M. Gossett, Biological Reductive Dechlorination of Tetrachloroethylene and Trichloroethylene to Ethylene Under Methanogenic Conditions, 55 Applied Environ. Microbiol. 2144-2155 (1989), first published the complete degradation pathway for chlorinated ethenes to ethene. In the following years, several publications reported evidence that the degradation could be achieved through microbial respiration, indicating that the microorganisms could actually grow by using chlorinated solvents directly as electron acceptors. The primary requirement to facilitate this process is the addition of a suitable electron donor or carbon source. Many electron donors have been described in the literature, including acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, formate, ethanol, hydrogen, and many others. U.S. Pat. No. 5,277,815 issued in 1994 for in situ electron donor addition along with control of redox conditions to effect the desired end products. U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,210 issued later for enhanced anaerobic in situ bioremediation using “biotransformation enhancing agents,” i.e., electron donors such as propylene glycol, glycerol, glutamate, a mixture of proteose peptone, beef extract, yeast extract, malt extract, dextrose, and ascorbic acid, and mixtures thereof. Based primarily on what was publicly available in the scientific literature, studies of enhanced anaerobic in situ bioremediation of chlorinated solvents began in the mid-1990s. This approach generally includes electron donor addition, sometimes with other micronutrients, to facilitate biotransformation of aqueous-phase contaminants. To date, only a few large-scale studies have been published in the peer-reviewed literature, but environmental consulting companies and remediation contractors are increasingly using the general approach.
With one very recent exception, discussed below, all of the work done in this area to date has focused on the biodegradation of aqueous contaminants, because microorganisms cannot directly degrade nonaqueous contaminants. Consequently, bioremediation is not generally thought to be applicable to sites with residual DNAPLs in the subsurface. Therefore, the technologies currently in use include thermal technologies such as steam stripping, in situ chemical oxidation, surfactant flushing, or co-solvent flushing. Surfactant (or co-solvent) flushing, briefly described above, is a chemical process that aims to facilitate transport of nonaqueous contaminants, but without attention to biodegradation. At many sites, however, the pump-and-treat process continues to be used to hydraulically contain residual source areas although it is almost universally accepted that these systems will have to operate",913,11, in perpetuity because of their inefficient removal of nonaque

Ministry | The gift of transport breaks down cultural and political barriers

""Mobile blessings"" Continued...

Larry Remp is a businessman from Ohio. His friend, Nguyen Hoang Vu, is a former underground pastor in Vietnam. Last November, communist officials in the Vietnamese city of Nha Trang shocked both men when they publicly acknowledged Vu's existence as a Christian pastor. Just a few years prior, Vu had faced imprisonment for preaching the gospel.

""It was incredible,"" said Remp, who has been traveling to Vietnam for 18 years to support His Place, the once-secret theological training facility that he and Vu established in 1990. What prompted the acknowledgment of God in a country with a history of repressing religion? A 40-foot shipping container full of odd-looking wheelchairs.

The wheelchairs came from Free Wheelchair Mission (FWM), a $5.4 million nonprofit charity based in Irvine, Calif., that manufactures simple but rugged wheelchairs for less than $50 each.

Since its founding in 2001, the group has sent more than 300,000 wheelchairs to 76 countries, including ones as troubled as Afghanistan, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malawi, Nepal, Sudan, and Uzbekistan.

During the November wheelchair distribution ceremony in Nha Trang, a coastal city about midway between Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, officials thanked Remp and his crew of volunteers. They also thanked Vu, FWM, and the Wheeling, W.Va., Vineyard Church, which raised $115,000 for the wheelchairs. Remp recalls, ""We were able to share that the wheelchairs were a gift from God.""

FWM founder and wheelchair inventor Don Schoendorfer, a shy, wiry man with a bushy gray mustache, was present at the Nha Trang ceremony. He was thrilled at the official response but not surprised. He has seen his device roll over political and cultural barriers before: ""A mission group often can't just walk in and help-however, if they have a bunch of wheelchairs, all of a sudden the doors open. They call to talk to the mayor and talk about the wheelchair donation-and they get respect. Then they can go in and identify needs and save lives.""

The seeds for Schoendorfer's $50 wheelchair were planted 30 years ago when, during a trip to Morocco, he and his wife Laurie saw beggars lining a road: ""Between the legs of the beggars... was this woman trying to get across the road. Literally dragging herself. With one arm. Her clothes were torn and she's bleeding and she's filthy and she just wants to get across the road. We didn't know what to do. All we could do was turn around and look the other way.""

But the vision of the Moroccan paraplegic clawing her way through life-a common sight in many developing countries-haunted the couple for three decades. During that span, Schoendorfer earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from MIT and found success in the biomedical industry. The couple raised three daughters in southern California. They went to church.

Yet something nagged at Schoendorfer: ""I got very good at being the guy in the back room, the inventor. So I'd work for one company, and we would become successful at the expense of another company. But after 25 years, was anyone going to care about what I'd invented?""

Recalling the Moroccan woman, Schoendorfer started to experiment. He wanted to craft a durable and cheap wheelchair, something that could be pushed along dirt roads, up rocky paths, through muddy trails-anywhere the poorest of the poor lived. For months during 1998 and 1999 he tinkered in his garage during the early hours before leaving for work. Eventually he hit upon the idea of using the ubiquitous molded plastic patio chair, the kind you can buy at Home Depot. In fact, that's where he got his first one. It was waterproof and washable, sturdy and relatively comfortable.

What about wheels? Again, Schoendorfer went the simple route: Toys R Us inflatable bike tires. At first he used narrow tires. Then he settled on tires made for mountain bikes. Since 2000, Schoendorfer has tweaked his original model a bit, but the basic idea has remained unchanged.

FWM mixes its unique concept with an efficient production and distribution method that keeps costs very low. First, the wheelchair design uses components already produced in high volume, from the plastic chair down to the nuts and bolts. Second, the components are packed and shipped from two factories in China, where labor is inexpensive.",972,11,"

It was April when an audio recording surfaced of Tyreek Hill threatening and arguing with his fiancee Crystal Espinal about allegations he broke their son’s arm. It rocked the NFL. The league announced on Friday that Hill would not be disciplined, but the Chiefs were prepared either way.

That preparation centered on drafting Georgia receiver Mecole Hardman in the second round this past spring. While no one can say for certain if Hardman was an insurance policy for Hill, you'd be a fool to think otherwise. One scout we spoke with compared him to DeSean Jackson, and some teams viewed the pick as one of the best of the draft.

The proof of this result occupies the bulk of this paper. Most of the page count is attributed to a detailed presentation of the required background material from linear algebra and probability. We have based the argument on the most elementary considerations possible, and we have tried to make the work self-contained. Once the reader has digested these ideas, the related—but more sophisticated —approach in the paper [@MJCFT14:Matrix-Concentration] should be accessible.

Discussion
----------

Before we continue, some remarks about Theorem \[thm:main\] are in order. First, although it may seem restrictive to focus on independent sums, as in , this model captures an enormous number of useful examples. See the monograph [@Tro15:Introduction-Matrix] for justification.

We have chosen the term *variance parameter* because the quantity  is a direct generalization of the variance of a scalar random variable. The passage from the first formula to the second formula in  is an immediate consequence of the assumption that the summands ${{\bm{S}}}_i$ are independent and have zero mean (see Section \[sec:upper\]). We use the term *large-deviation",965,11, parameter* because the quantity  reflects the part of the

El 6 de agosto de 2014 se publicó el Real Decreto de Troncalidad en el BOE[@bib0005], y también con él se creó la especialidad de genética clínica para médicos, biólogos, farmacéuticos y químicos. Pero, de momento está en desarrollo. Somos de los últimos países en Europa que tienen dicha especialidad, por lo que estamos en el pelotón de cola. Como consecuencia de lo anterior en el currículum formativo del médico de familia español NO se encuentran sus competencias en genética clínica. Esas competencias ya se recogen en varios países de nuestro entorno[@bib0010].

Desde el Grupo de Trabajo SEMFYC sobre «Genética Clínica y Enfermedades Raras» estamos trabajando para que las cosas cambien. Sabemos que en el currículum formativo del médico de familia español NO se contemplan las competencias en genética clínica. Por eso, en noviembre de 2015 escribimos a la Comisión Nacional de Medicina Familiar y Comunitaria del Consejo Nacional de Especialidades en Ciencias de la Salud, para informarles de las competencias y habilidades en esta materia que se deberían acometer dentro del periodo formativo del MIR de medicina de familia.

Las habilidades que todo médico de familia español debe conocer para desarrollar correctamente su rol dentro de su área de conocimientos de la genética clínica son: *1)* Saber construir un árbol genealógico detallado, y de 3 generaciones según la nomenclatura estandarizada. Genetistas y médicos de familia comparten la visión de que los pacientes se perciben en familias y no como entes aislados; *2)* Conocer los diversos patrones de herencia: autosómico dominante, autosómico recesivo, ligado al cromosoma X, mitocondrial,..., y saberlos identificar en el árbol genealógico de las familias atendidas; *3)* Conocer los criterios de derivación, para derivar todo tipo de enfermedades genético-hereditarias, incluidas las agregaciones familiares de cáncer, desde la atención primaria a los centros clínicos de referencia; *4)* Conocer las enfermedades genéticas más frecuentes en atención primaria, y también las 10-15 enfermedades raras de los pacientes del propio cupo de médico de familia, con el uso del Protocolo DICE-APER ([http://dice-aper.semfyc.es](http://dice-aper.semfyc.es/){#intr0005}); *5)* Saber comunicar al pac",836,11,iente los posibles problemas genético-
279,0,20130,2050,", a society in all its colours—in which everyone is comfortable being who they are—comes to my mind. I see a society in which the political ideals of fraternity and equality have been accepted by our collective mind, in which we are so informed and educated that we never allow communalistic designs of sycophants to succeed.

I imagine an India where everyone has a voice, not just because the constitution has given her a voice, but because others let her speak and encourage her to speak if she doesn’t. In my India, everyone should be able to use her voice without fear, especially against those who want to benefit from the differences of People. An India in which everyone is an equal partner and doesn’t have to ‘sell’ his ‘voice’ in exchange for a privilege, which should be his right. An India in which an imposed equality has been naturalized.

Having said that, two major two issues are plaguing India, both connected and blocking India’s progress towards a visionistic future.

Problem 1: Centralization Of Power

One is of course: the centralization of power via a devious mechanism, prevalent throughout the world and an opposition which (I must humbly accept) could not offer a solid defense; the citizens of India gave too much power in the hands of one person/party. This centralization of power is two-fold: one, how power got concentrated in the hands of one political party with a well-known political mission of control and exclusion, and the other: how that power in the political party is concentrated in one or two hands. This is alarming because no democracy can live through such a concentration of power, without getting derailed. In such cases, there is no democracy, in effect.

When power is centralized in a few hands, the idea of ‘partnership’ goes to the bins because a section of society (who are on the receiving end of those in power) go ‘rogue’ and start flexing their arms, and can spew all the venom inside them. They become unabashed and start ‘breaking’ the rules (which is on a whole new plane as compared with the idea of ‘skirting’ the rules). They thrust aside anyone who does not agree with him, and this is visible everywhere. I do not need to point out various incidents exemplifying a case in point specifically. Today, the centralization of power has led to a devious form of intolerance, and violence has become the norm.

Problem 2: Deeply Hierarchical Social Stratification

The second problem thwarting any possible vision for India is deeply (often not visible to naked eyes) hierarchical social stratification. It is important to note that diversity is not the problem; a multicultural society is not the problem. The problem is social stratification, gradations of the communities and sub-communities, encoded in books like Manusmriti and now thought-structures of people. These deeply embedded notions of hierarchy conflict with the idea of partnership, according to which, despite our differences, we should be politically equal.

A possible, and in my opinion, the most powerful tool against the above-mentioned two-pronged enemies of social stratification (visible in the form of centralization and hierarchy-based division of society) is LOVE. Man, by his animalistic nature, is after power, yes. But the most powerful thing in the world is love, however abstract it may sound.

But again, love is abstract because it is very difficult to articulate in the form of ‘deeply scientific (post-reason)’ language that all humankind possesses. What we may not articulate in language does not necessarily have to be non-existent. And we just need to look at common examples from life. Love, somehow, rules the actions of people.

We do things for people we love, we fight for them, we travel hundreds of kilometers for them. Love is more primal to us than is often mentioned. Love is the most natural thing amongst us humans, and not just humans, all the animals understand what love is. I don’t think I need to give specific examples.

Now, this feeling of love, so central to us despite our differences becomes a common locus for us. We interact with each other, we hug each other, we forget our identities, we forget if we are Hindus or Muslims. We get rid of the notions of superiority/inferiority based on the caste-system. And I think by way of normalization, a continuous application of love for fellow beings, can rid us of the social and political walls that divide us.

I have a vision of India, where in addition to the Constitution,",991,11, love is another central force. Where love is the playground

THE BARD AND THE DREAMS


O'er the sweet smelling meads with his lyre in his hand
   The bard was straying;
In the twilight of evening, refreshing and bland,
   His chords were playing.
He sang of the flowrets that slept in the tomb,
He sang of the flowrets that poured their perfume,
He sang of the flowrets that yet were to bloom.

And the rose departed,
A smile from its sepulchre darted;
And the rose yet living with blushes of red
Breathed sweets o'er his head.
And the rose which unborn concealed yet lies,
Seemed to open before his eyes.
   By a fountain's side with verdure array'd
   Himself he laid.

And the murmur and hum of the pure water fleeting,
And the strains, which the birds of the wood were repeating,
And the innocent heart, which so peaceful was beating,
   Shed health-giving slumbers,
   On lids which no sorrow cumbers.

In the visions of sleep there came to his side
   A sire with locks snow-hoary;
And the songster sped with that sire for his guide
   To an unknown territory.

On ruins majestic himself he found,
The mouldering bones of old heroes lay round;
   Their ghosts awaking
   Rose from their graves wild gestures making.
   The youth was quaking--
But the old man smiled as his mind he led
To the kempion times long fled.

Then a lamp in the night's deep silence shone
   Through the dingy mould,
And under the masses of fallen stone
   There glittered gold.

To the harp then pointing the sage disappears,
And the youth shed tears.
""Yes, yes, the young bard thy countenance knows,""
   So sang in wild passion the boy--
""Not in vain in my bosom a holy fire glows,
Not in vain thy bright lamp the grave's mystery shews,
   The bard will obey thee with joy.""

Again there appeared in the dreams of the stripling
   A being who held him intent;

Stood the spirit blest.

Permanent damage to neurons can occur during brief periods of hypoxia, anoxia or ischemia. Neurotoxic injury is known to be caused or accelerated by certain excitatory amino acids (RAA) found naturally in the central nervous system (CNS). Glutamate (Glu) is an endogenous amino acid which has been characterized as a fast excitatory transmitter in the mammalian brain. Glutamate is also known as a powerful neurotoxin capable of killing CNS neurons under certain pathological conditions which accompany stroke and cardiac arrest. Normal glutamate concentrations are maintained within brain tissue by energy-consuming transport systems. Under low energy conditions which occur during conditions of hypoglycemia, hypoxia or ischemia, cells can release glutamate. Under such low energy conditions the cell is not able to take glutamate back into the cell. Initial glutamate release stimulates further release of glutamate which results in an extracellular glutamate accumulation and a cascade of neurotoxic injury.
It has been shown that the sensitivity of central neurons to hypoxia and ischemia can be reduced by either blockage of synaptic transmission or by the specific antagonism of postsynaptic glutamate receptors [see S. M. Rothman and J. W. Olney, ""Glutamate and the Pathophysiology of Hypoxia-Ischemic Brain Damage,"" Annals of Neurology, 19 No. 2 (1986)]. Glutamate is characterized as a broad spectrum agonist having activity at three neuronal excitatory amino acid receptor sites. These receptor sites are named after the amino acids which selectively excite them, namely: Kainate (KA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA or NMA) and quisqualate (QUIS).
Neurons which have EAA receptors on their dendritic or somal surfaces undergo acute excitotoxic degeneration when these receptors are excessively activated by glutamate. Thus, agents which selectively block or antagonize the action of glutamate at the EAA synaptic receptors of central neurons can prevent neurotoxic injury associated with hypoxia, anoxia, or ischemia caused by stroke, cardiac arrest or perinatal asphyxia.
It is known that compounds of various structures, such as aminophosphonovalerate derivatives and piperidine dicarboxylate derivatives, may act as competitive antagonists at the NMDA receptor. Certain piperidineethanol derivatives, such as ifenprodil and 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-piperidinyl]ethanol, which are known anti-ischemic agents, have been found to be non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists [C. Carter et al, J. Pharm Exp. Ther, 247 (3), 1222-",602,11,"1232 (1988)].

Therefore, the $\lambda_0$ for the shortest spiking time with control $I^*$ satisfying $|I^*(t)|\leq M$ can be calculated by substituting $I^*=M$ and $\theta=\pi/2$ to the equation, and then from we obtain this shortest spiking period $$\label{eq:min_time_UBC}

====================

In retinal degenerative diseases, light-sensitive photoreceptors often die due to mutations in genes specifically expressed in these cells. This photoreceptor-specific defect will lead to a series of cellular changes, which would ultimately affect the well-being of the whole retina. For example, in a zebrafish mutant *pde6c*^*w59*^ (*pde6c*), an A\>G point mutation was identified in the *pde6c (phosphodiesterase 6C, cGMP-specific, cone, alpha prime)* gene^[@b1]^. This mutation was predicted to cause a frameshift in the coding sequence and result either in a truncated PDE6C or degradation of *pde6c* mRNA through nonsense-mediated decay. This mutation ultimately affects both cone and rod photoreceptors.

In wild-type zebrafish retina, photoreceptor progenitors withdraw from the cell cycle at 48 h post-fertilization (hpf) to form the photoreceptor precursors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL)^[@b2]^. These precursors will begin to differentiate into rods and cones at 50 hpf in a ventral part of the retina^[@b3]^. Then, cones gradually distribute evenly throughout retina; whereas rods distribute sporadically in the retina, with higher density in the ventral region. By 3 dpf, these photoreceptors are mature enough that the fish larvae will display the first visually-evoked startle response^[@b4]^. In *pde6c*, cones seem to develop following the normal course.

By downplaying and misrepresenting our environmental crisis, David Attenborough and the BBC have generated complacency, confusion and ignorance.

By George Monbiot, published in the Guardian, 7th Novemeber 2018

Knowingly creating a false impression of the world: this is a serious matter. It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, Sir David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”.

His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts.” In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems, and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths, I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.

It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect.

For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action.

You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife filmmakers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know, and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it, that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world which persuades us that all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it.

What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it.

Since 1985, when I started work in the department that has made most of his programmes, I’ve pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995, I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’. I said yes. He said,",729,11, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to
290,0,20572,0,"Passenger Pigeon

How could the passenger pigeon be extinct when it was the most abundant bird species on Earth no so long ago? It is almost impossible to imagine that the passenger pigeons’ population, which in the early 1800’s contained more individuals than all other North American birds combined, was reduced to just one individual, Martha, who died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.

Before their decimation, a single flock of passenger pigeons could have 2 billion birds or more, and there were multiple flocks of birds in the United States.

When John J. Audubon observed a migrating flock over Kentucky in 1813, he reported that the sky was “black with birds” for three days.

The nesting colonies of the passenger pigeon in northeastern deciduous forests could be 20 miles across, with so many birds per tree that the branches broke from their weight. Yet, there is not a single passenger pigeon left for us to observe today.

The passenger pigeon was driven to extinction by uncontrolled commercial hunting for their meat, which was desired by Euroamerican settlers.

The passenger pigeons‘ migration and nesting behavior made them easy to hunt in large numbers. They were netted, shot and smoked out of trees with sulfur torches. Special firearms, including a forerunner of the machine gun, were used to harvest these birds in quantity.

The growth of commercial enterprises was facilitated by the railroads, which made it possible (and profitable) to transport the meat quickly to urban centers.

By 1850, several thousand people were employed in the passenger pigeon industry. In New York, one operation processed 18,000 pigeons each day in 1855. In one year in Michigan alone, a billion birds were harvested.

Not surprisingly, the population collapsed. Although several thousand birds survived in 1880, it was no longer profitable to hunt them since they were widely dispersed across the continent. Ironically, this scattered distribution, which saved a large core population for the post-commercial era, may also have contributed to the passenger pigeon’s ultimate demise by interfering with breeding abilities.

The reasons that the passenger pigeon was unable to recover from the period of overexploitation are not fully known. Some species have been able to recover from a low number of individuals, but the passenger pigeon continued to decline and was extinct in the wild by 1900. Captive breeding efforts were not successful and the last individual died in 1914.

One theory explaining the passenger pigeon’s inability to recover is that their breeding patterns required a community of numerous individuals to stimulate the necessary cycles or behaviors. Previously, the large colonies had provided the necessary conditions, but the scattered populations after 1880 may not have had a large enough concentration in any one area to stimulate breeding behaviors.

The passenger pigeon’s inability to recover may also have been influenced by the scattered distribution of remaining individuals by making it more difficult to find suitable mates. Without their swarming flocks, the passenger pigeons also may have had trouble competing with other birds for nest sites, and nest sites may have been fewer as the deciduous forests were cut down.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that the passenger pigeon did not have a viable populationwhen commercial hunting ceased. Although commercial hunting did not directly kill the last passenger pigeon, it sent the species into an extinction vortex from which it could not recover.

Questions for Thought:

Passenger pigeons were one of the most important food resources for numerous carnivores, such as foxes, lynx, raccoons, marten and mink, and for several raptors, such as falcons and hawks. What repercussions would the passenger pigeon’s extinction have for these species? What other effects might have occurred in the ecosystem?

One of the things that died with the passenger pigeon was the phenomenon of its migration, the endless sea of birds blackening the sky. Even if the passenger pigeon had survived as a species, this impressive phenomenon could not have continued without the huge number of birds that existed in the early 1800s.

291,0,22613,1025," 2004, the Department of Justice began checking prospective gun buyers against what the FBI calls the Known or Suspected Terrorist File — which includes the Terrorist Screening Database, commonly referred to as the FBI’s terrorist watch list, as explained in a May 2013 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. A match in the terrorist database triggers an automatic 72-hour delay, even if there are no other so-called “prohibiting factors.”

It may be, for example, that the FBI has disqualifying information on that individual that is not entered in the NICS databases.

CRS, May 1, 2013: During a delay, NICS staff contacts immediately the FBI Headquarters’ Counterterrorism Division and FBI Special Agents in the field, and a coordinated effort is made to research possibly unknown prohibiting factors. If no prohibiting factors are uncovered within this three-day period, firearms dealers may proceed with the transaction at their discretion. However, FBI counterterrorism officials continue to work the case for up to 90 days in case disposition information is returned that permits a final determination.

So Lankford is correct that the “FBI is pinged” whenever an individual on a terrorist watch list tries to buy a gun. But the sale can proceed after three days — and that’s exactly what has happened in the vast majority of cases, as we mentioned earlier.

Since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System began checking prospective gun buyers against terrorist watch list records in February 2004, “individuals on the terrorist watch list were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,477 times, of which 2,265 (about 91 percent) of the transactions were allowed to proceed and 212 were denied,” according to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. (See GAO chart below for more details.)

By law, all identifying information about the buyer in cases like this must be destroyed in 90 days, except for the transaction number and date. But the CRS says “it is unknown what happens to the information generated by NICS-related terrorist watchlist hits that are passed on to the FBI Counterterrorism Division and investigative personnel in the field.” It is possible that that information is “recorded and stored electronically in the FBI’s investigative case files.”

An FBI spokesman told us that the FBI can open an investigation if there is probable cause. FBI guidelines say a preliminary investigation may be opened “on the basis of any ‘allegation or information’ indicative of possible criminal activity or threats to the national security.”

We take no position on Feinstein’s amendment. But Lankford isn’t telling the whole story when he says that individuals on a terrorist watch list “cannot just walk in and buy a firearm” at a gun store. They can after a three-day wait, and nine out of 10 of those who have tried have done so.

Americans on the Terrorist Watch List

On ABC’s “This Week,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined — twice — to say how many Americans are on the terrorist watch list, claiming “we don’t provide those exact numbers” or even a range. That’s false. Federal officials have told Congress that the number of “U.S. persons” on terrorist watch lists ranges from 5,000 to 15,000.

Lynch made her remarks when asked about Feinstein’s amendment by “This Week” host Jonathan Karl.

Karl, June 19: The Justice Department has come out in favor of this idea of the no-fly, no-buy. If you’re on the terrorist watch list, the no-fly list, you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. How many Americans are on the terrorist watch list? Lynch: You know, we don’t provide those exact numbers. Karl: Can you give me a range? I mean, what are we talking about here? Lynch: Well, as I said we don’t provide those exact numbers.

As we have written before, there are multiple databases that contain the names of suspected or known terrorists. The largest is the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE. The National Counterterrorism Center maintains TIDE, which the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in a 2013 report referred to as the government’s “central repository” of international terrorists and suspected terrorists.

HOW IS THE FOOD SERVED?
SETH: There are different service styles we use depending on what the needs are. Sometimes we serve it to you right in your seat; sometimes it’s at the after-party.
[When food is served in the theater,] you’re trying to serve a hot dish of food to a specific frame in a film. When the audience sees it onscreen, and they say, “Wow! I wonder what that tastes like,” boom! You want to hand it to them right there.
What you would see there is very choreographed, almost like a ballet. Imagine people sitting in the theater. You’ll see two lines of servers walk down the aisle. They’ll pass the tray down the aisle. Each person takes one and passes it down. Then they pick up the tray. If it works right, it happens in 20 seconds. You don’t even know they were there.
WHAT ARE THE AFTER-PARTIES LIKE?
SETH: We do the after-party right down the hall [from the theater] in this room they have called the Skyline, which has big windows. You can see the city, and it’s a big party space. And we have a DJ who travels with us from New York, DJ Keili from Brooklyn. She comes with us and spins at every event.
HOW ARE THE FILMS SELECTED?
SETH: The competition is open to films of any length…The only requirement to be in the festival is that it has to be about food or drink. There’s a selection committee that picks the films that will be screened, and then the judging panel chooses the awardees… It is true that most of the event ended up being a series of shorts. Just because when you’re trying to give people many different flavors, you want different things.
HOW DID THE FEST GET STARTED?
SETH: George Motz, who you might know—he’s a host on the Travel Channel—he made a film way back about hamburgers called Hamburger America. It did really well. There was a book deal, and he quickly became—without even wanting to—America’s hamburger expert. That’s how he ended up with the Travel Channel show [Burger Land, which premiered in April of this year].
When they were going to premiere the film [in 2004], they said, “Why don’t we make some of the hamburgers from the film?” And they did that, and they served them while [people] were watching. Everybody flipped out. And they said, “This is great! why stop at burgers? Let’s do everything.” And that’s how it was born.",764,11,"

The common differentials in the general population include neurocysticercosis, tuberculomas, brain abscesses, and metastatic lesions. In AIDS patients, the major differential diagnosis is between central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and CNS toxoplasmosis. How can one envisage the role of ^18^F-FDG-PET/CT in this scenario as a valuable adjunct to further a definitive diagnosis? For the purpose of systematic discussion, we would approach the problem by considering each of the differential diagnoses separately in this clinical setting.

In a recent study, Jolepalem and Wong [@R1] have observed a relatively low-grade/absent ^18^F-FDG uptake in lesions of neurocysticercosis. This finding is relatively consistent with that in a few published case reports by other authors [@R2] and we have also made a similar observation in our practice ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). This low uptake of ^18^F-FDG-PET in neurocysticercosis is noteworthy, especially as there is now substantial evidence in the literature on infective--inflammatory lesions demonstrating avid ^18^F-FDG uptake commensurate with their inflammatory activity.

Based on this determination, the district court granted the Agacinskis a partial summary judgment and held that (1) Zamborowski negligently handled the Agacinskis' state court litigation;  and (2) Zamborowski's negligence proximately caused the Agacinskis' injuries.   Because the district court granted summary judgment on the liability issue, the court concluded the only issue remaining for trial was the issue of damages.   Subsequently, the issues for trial were further narrowed when, just prior to the damages trial, Zamborowski agreed to settle the damages related to the lien placed on the Agacinskis' home.

Finally, Stanley Agacinski admitted, in effect, that (1) the Agacinskis' damages were tied to the question of whether the Agacinskis owed money to the Collinses, or vice versa;  and (2) it was totally speculative as to which party owed the other party money.

At the conclusion of the Agacinskis' case, Zamborowski moved for, and received, a directed verdict on the damages issue.   In granting the directed verdict, the district court stated from the bench:


9
Mr. Agacinski in his testimony which the Court had reread to it in chambers by the court reporter said that he did not know whether the joint venture with the Collinses experienced a profit or a loss.   Plaintiffs have introduced no other evidence to show that the joint venture made a profit and the Court believes it would be speculative to permit the jury to presume that the joint venture made a profit.


10
Moreover, the court will say all of the damages claimed by the plaintiff in this Court's opinion are damages resulting from the breach of the contract which created the joint venture....


11
The Court now therefore grants a directed verdict on the remaining portion of the claim in favor of the defendant because the Court feels the plaintiffs have failed in their proofs.

I hope that you find these New Year’s resolutions from Trulia useful. Got any resolutions for the real estate industry that we should be considering?

Trulia update
Here is a quick update on what has been going on with Trulia in the last 12 months and where we’re headed.

Today, Trulia.com is the fastest growing website in the real estate industry according to Comscore (at least amongst the top 20 sites). In December 2007 Trulia.com will have around 2.5million unique visitors, we have grown 3x in 12 months whereas many other sites have flat or declining in traffic. We consistently see double digit monthly growth and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future until we become one of the top few sites in the Industry.

Trulia has been launching lots of products in 2007 as well as coming out of Beta, some highlights: in May we launched the useful and popular Trulia Voices community; in November we launched our integrated Foreclosure search and also in November made available our agent listing advertising product. We will be launching many more products and services in 2008 as well as improving many of the existing products on Trulia.com. We are particularly excited about building on the early success of Trulia Voices and become the leading online community for home buyers, sellers, agents and enthusiasts.

In 2007 we raised an additional $10m lead by Sequoia Capital with participation from existing investors such as Accel Partners and have raised a total of around $18m to date. It’s a great endorsement for the Trulia business model, chosen strategy and the team here from some of smartest and most successful minds in technology. Trulia has approximately doubled its staff to around 55 employees in 12 months (and we’re hiring). Most importantly, we’ve continued to deliver great value to our real estate industry partners and other advertisers. As a result of making our clients happy, we’re now starting to generate pretty significant revenues and with Trulia’s capital efficient model and a highly sought after audience, we’ll be focused on achieving profitability in 2008. Since inception, our goal has been to build a marketing platform that delivers greater value at a lower cost than any other option out there, whether online or offline. This is a great start and we will continue on this path. We’ll let you know how we get on in 2008.

Wishing you all a very Happy New Year and good luck with your own New Year resolutions from everyone at Trulia!

Yesterday, we fought with tech support of our Internet service provider…for hours. They kept putting us on hold, handing us to different departments, saying one thing, then contradicting themselves. Seems the corporate behemoth would see fit to train their support personnel.

Now, today, the stress is catching up with me. I haven’t yearned for a cigarette like this in years. Years!

My wife and I quit smoking 8 or 9 years ago. We kept track of the date for some time. After a while, it didn’t matter. What mattered was we actually did quit. For good.

We Quit for Good

Not one cigarette since. Not when we were stressed. Not with morning coffee. Not when inadvertently inhaling the allure and promise of second hand smoke. Not when a friend across the table lit up; not even when the friend gestured to help ourselves to the pack.

Our minds’, “One won’t matter. I quit once, I can do it again anytime I want” justification never did get the best of us.

Quitting smoking was the hardest thing I ever did.

Oh, I had quit before. Many times. Before I met Mari.

Most quitting lasted just long enough to reason with myself that I was young and I had plenty of time to quit. I really didn’t need to do it now. Why not enjoy myself? I could quit later!

I even quit for a month and a half, once.

That was broken one evening when I went to a bar and proceeded to get slightly drunk. A friend was with me. He smoked.

Like an everlasting fool, I asked him for a cigarette. He asked me if I was sure. “Sure I’m sure,” I said. “I’m no longer a smoker. I’ll prove to you I can smoke one cigarette and never smoke again.”

He said, “No, you can’t. If you really want a cigarette, I’ll give it to you. But I tell you now, you will become a smoker again.”

He was right.

Duke Johnson has everything - money, power, and respect. He's the self-proclaimed ruler of Babylon, the sexiest party underworld in Detroit, and he can have anything and every woman he wants. That is, until he meets Victoria.

Victoria has lost both her parents, and now that she;s moved from her upper class home in suburbia into her grandmother's run-down shack in the hood, she's about to lose something else - her virtue.

===============

Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy with a prevalence of 335,000 and incidence of 37,200 in the United States in 2009 \[[@B1]\]. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma, namely papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma, makes up about 94% of these cases. Despite the generally good prognosis of thyroid carcinoma, about 5% of patients will develop metastatic disease which fails to respond to radioactive iodine, exhibiting a more aggressive behavior. These patients will die of their disease \[[@B1]--[@B4]\].

85% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas are cured with surgery, radioactive iodine, and TSH suppression. Of those that recur, the vast majority will recur in the neck, and best treatment options are surgical with potential further radioactive iodine. A small percentage of patients will develop or present with metastases and are more difficult to treat. When metastases have radioiodine avidity, prognosis is better, and further radioactive iodine may be used. However, when multiple doses of radioactive iodine have been tried or the patient has nonradioactive iodine avid disease, other options need to be considered. This paper will aim to discuss the treatment options of those patients with nonradioiodine avid, recurrent, or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.

2. Diagnosis of Recurrent/Metastatic Disease Extent {#sec2}
===================================================

Screening ultrasound of the neck and tumor marker (thyroglobulin) should be performed on all patients with differentiated thyroid cancer,per accepted guidelines \[[@B5]\]. The finding of an elevated thyroglobulin or thyroglobulin antibody in the face of a negative radioactive iodine scan is indicative of non-radioiodine avid residual or recurrent disease. Both ultrasound of the neck and thin spiral CT of the chest should be performed for detection of disease. If symptoms occur or the thyroglobulin is out of proportion to the amount of disease seen, other imaging can be ordered as dictated by the clinical scenario. Other imaging modalities include MRI of the brain, spine, bone scan, and ^18^FDG-PET/CT scans. [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=""table""} summarizes the imaging modalities used in thyroid cancer surveillance.

2.1. Role of Ultrasound {#sec2.1}
-----------------------

Ultrasonography (U/S) of the neck (thyroid bed and cervical neck compartments), as opposed to RAI scans, is recommended in the followup of these patients. This shift in practice is due to the fact that many recurrent tumors lose the ability to capture iodine, leading to false negatives. As many as half of the patients with findings of recurrence on U/S may have no uptake on radioiodine scanning or may have an undetectable serum thyroglobulin \[[@B6]\].",629,11,"

Hello Everyone! At approximately 16:01 UTC 15/1/2018, the very much hyped MimbleWimble protocol enabled privacy coin Grin coin was launched. Since then, miners all around the world have been asking the same question: “How do I mine some Grins?” and today we’ll be covering some of the basics of mining Grin on Windows 10 with NVIDIA GPUs.

A step by step run down will be given and if you follow them, you should be able to mine just fine and leave with a Grin 😀 on your face.

What is Grin?

In short - Grin is a privacy coin that uses the MimbleWimble protocol and runs on the Cuckoo Proof of Work (PoW) cycle and is designed to be hard on memory, requiring miners to have cards with high memory capacity (eg. Nvidia 1070/1080 with 8gb vram). Also, Cuckoo PoW has 2 modes - c29 which favors GPUs, and c31 which favors ASICs. In this guide we will be focusing on c29 for GPUs as the ASICs have yet to be released.

304,0,27349,0,"Luckily there is a whole literature of books available for parents and parents-to-be in which experienced mothers and fathers or, better still, professionals, discuss new models and techniques to bring up children. Just some examples of best-sellers in this genre are “Simplicity : Using the extraordinary power of less to raise calmer, happier, and more secure kids” by consultants Kim John Payne and Lisa M. Rose. Or what to think of “Scream-free parenting: The revolutionary approach to raising your kids by keeping your cool” by Hal Edward Runkel. Undoubtedly there are many useful insights in these books that can address people’s’ real anxieties and make them become better parents.

As an evolutionary minded psychologist, and a father, it always struck me that parenting should be one of the things that we humans are naturally good at. I am the descendant of many generations of individuals, men and women, who have all done a reasonably job at parenting, otherwise I would simply not be here writing this blog. Maybe this explains why I never once read a self-help parenting book. It is true though that our way of parenting has probably changed quite a bit since our ancestors moved out of Africa. Our ancestors did not have to bring up their children in large and crowded cities, with many strangers abound, lots of traffic, material possessions, and vast differences in wealth between families.

Yet it interesting to find out more about how families in traditional societies raise their children because such societies are the ones in which humans lived in for generations and this may have resulted in particular parenting styles. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of research out there as most developmental psychologists (including theorists such as Piaget, Kohlberg and ) have tended to study children in WEIRD-cultures (western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic).

Recently I came across the new book by the renowned evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond, titled “The world until yesterday” in which he devotes an entire chapter to parenting in the “Stone Age.” This is based on his own personal observations doing field work in New Guinea and a handful of studies by ethnographers of parenting in tribes like the!Kung San in the Kalahari Desert, the Hadza in Tanzania, the Piraha in the Amazonian Rainforest and the Inuit in Alaska.

A consistent observation among the anthropologists studying these children is how confident, competent, and autonomous they are despite -- or perhaps because of -- their lack of material possessions and access to technology.

Looking at what parenting tips can be gleaned",539,11, from these tribal societies some of them are not very practical
305,0,24860,0,"When Gerald Celente branded the American media “presstitutes,” he got it right. The US print and TV media (and NPR) whore for Washington and the corporations. Reporting the real news is their last concern. The presstitutes are a Ministry of Propaganda and Coverup. This is true of the entire Western media, a collection of bought-and-paid-for whores.

It seems that every day I witness a dozen or more examples. Take May 31 for example.
The presstitutes report that US Secretary of State John Kerry and his German counterpart are working on Russia to convince that country to be a “party to peace” in Syria by not supplying the Syrian government, whose country has been invaded, with arms. Kerry and the Israelis especially do not want Russia to deliver the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system to Syria.

This was the extent of the presstitutes’ report. The presstitutes made no mention of the fact that the invasion of Syria by al-Qaeda affiliated radical Muslims was organized and equipped by Washington via its proxies in the region, such as Saudia Arabia and the oil emirates. Americans sufficiently stupid to rely on the presstitute media do not know that it is not Syrians who want to overthrow their government, but Washington, Israel, and radical Islamists who object to Syria’s secular non-confrontational government.

One might think that the US media would wonder why Washington prefers to have al-Qaeda governing Syria than a non-confrontational secular government. But such a question is off-limits for the US media.

Israel, unlike Washington which so far hides behind proxies, has actually openly committed war crimes as defined by the Nuremberg trials of Nazis by initiating unprovoked aggression against Syria by militarily attacking the country.

In reporting Kerry’s pressure on Putin, presstitutes made no mention that the Washington-backed attempted overthrow of the Syrian government has run into difficulty, causing president obama to ask the Pentagon to come up with a no-fly plan, which means according to the Libya precedent NATO or US air attacks on Syrian government forces. As the S-300 missiles are a defensive weapon, obama’s plan to send in Western or Israeli air forces to attack the Syrian army is why Kerry is pressuring Russia not to honor its contract to deliver to Syria the S-300 missiles, which can knock US, NATO, and Israeli aircraft out of the sky.

Those who believed that Kerry could have made a difference as president must be disillusioned to see what a warmongering whore he is. In america marketing is everything; truth is nothing.

The real news story is that Washington is trying to convince Putin to acquiesce to
Washington’s overthrow of the Syrian government so that Russia can be evicted from its only naval base in the Mediterranean Sea, thus making it Washington’s sea, Washington’s Mare",614,11, Nostrum. The american pressitutes put all the

Although OTC markets are usually well organized, they are less formal. In particular, there is no central authority which would regulate the conditions of the derivative contracts or would control the fulfillment of these conditions.

OTC derivatives are usually preferred over the exchange traded ones because taxes and other expenses are lower and they are much more flexible, meaning that the counterparties can agree on very specific or unusual conditions as opposed to the limited set of derivative types designed and operated by an exchange. As a trade-off for flexibility and the possibility of higher earnings OTC derivatives bear significant additional risks as compared to the exchange traded ones.

Risk involved in OTC derivatives {#sec004}
--------------------------------

Derivatives are generally used to hedge risks, but derivatives themselves are a source of risk. These are credit risk and market risk, along with liquidity, operational and legal risks \[[@pone.0136638.ref002]\]. In case of OTC derivatives, credit risk is the main source of risk because of the usual absence of a clearing house that guarantees the fulfillment of obligations between parties. Thus, the two contracting parties are exposed to *counterparty default risk*, i.e., the risk that a counterparty will undergo distress, or even default prior to expiration of the contract and thus will not make the current and future payments. In contrast to lending risk, to which only the party which lends is exposed, both sides involved in OTC contract are exposed to counterparty risk. To have some sort of mitigation, the parties involved in OTC derivatives are usually banks which act on their own behalf or on behalf of their clients.

There are different ways to mitigate counterparty risk in case of default. For example, using close-out netting agreements allows that all contracts are netted, eliminating the possibility of selective execution of contracts \[[@pone.0136638.ref003]\]. For *bilateral close-out netting*, which mostly applies to OTC derivatives markets, the two parties agree to net with one another, i.e., to set off gains and losses from *all* of their bilateral contracts. This differs from the case of multilateral close-out netting which mostly applies to ETD, i.e., to markets where all parties' obligations are netted together. In both cases, netting is only a procedure to follow after a default and thus does not address the *emergence* of counterparty risk.

It is obvious that netting decreases credit exposure, as it takes into account only the *net* obligations, thus reducing both operational and settlement risk and operational costs. In order to know the risk, the *present value* of contracts, prior to their contracted termination, has to be determined. Outstanding contracts are marked to market, taking into account the *replacement costs*, i.e., the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. This assessment of credit exposure at a single point in time is denoted as *current credit exposure* (CCE). However, derivative contracts usually have considerable lifetimes and are very often characterized by fast and large changes in credit exposure. Therefore, the *potential future exposure* (P",683,11,FE) is used to estimate the possible CCE increase

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)

Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology.

The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years.

The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. ""Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,"" he said.

Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)

Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW.

The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. ""They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market.""

Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035.

How to handle camel-quickfix CannotSendException?

I am using QuickFix/J 1.6.4 in a camel-quickfix component. Sometimes, I get the CannotSendException and it is not clear, what the exception cause is. I looked at the code, but there it seems that this exception is thrown, when the message could not be send - regardless of the reason.
So how do I have to handle this exception? Do I have to implement a retry mechanism, or does the engine handle this for me? If the engine does, how can I verify, that the message is sent afterwards?

Here we present the high-resolution structure of bacteriophage PR772 using electron cryo-microscopy (CryoEM). The high-resolution map helped us to resolve subtle variations in the protein conformations and their influence on the formation of a viable viral particle.

316,0,24342,0,"'Ring-enhancing brain lesions with clinical presentation of focal seizures and inconclusive diagnostic features on anatomical neuroimaging modalities' is an area that continues to challenge attending neurologists with regard to the definitive etiologic diagnosis; therapeutic approaches are clearly different and an accurate diagnosis is of great importance in each of these settings; in addition, some of the conditions are potentially treatable. The common differentials in the general population include neurocysticercosis, tuberculomas, brain abscesses, and metastatic lesions. In AIDS patients, the major differential diagnosis is between central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and CNS toxoplasmosis. How can one envisage the role of ^18^F-FDG-PET/CT in this scenario as a valuable adjunct to further a definitive diagnosis? For the purpose of systematic discussion, we would approach the problem by considering each of the differential diagnoses separately in this clinical setting.

In a recent study, Jolepalem and Wong [@R1] have observed a relatively low-grade/absent ^18^F-FDG uptake in lesions of neurocysticercosis. This finding is relatively consistent with that in a few published case reports by other authors [@R2] and we have also made a similar observation in our practice ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}). This low uptake of ^18^F-FDG-PET in neurocysticercosis is noteworthy, especially as there is now substantial evidence in the literature on infective--inflammatory lesions demonstrating avid ^18^F-FDG uptake commensurate with their inflammatory activity.

![A 48-year-old man who presented with a recent history of left-sided focal seizure that started a month ago. (a) Plain and postcontrast MRI demonstrating a thick irregular peripherally enhancing lesion in the right frontal parafalcine region. This appeared hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images. Associated surrounding edema was observed. (b) The ^18^F-FDG-PET/CT-fused images demonstrating no appreciable ^18^F-FDG uptake in the mentioned region.](mnm-34-1237-g001){#F1}

Although the low ^18^F-FDG uptake in neurocysticercosis is uniform in all the published reports, there has been conflicting results and an overlap of ^18^F-FDG uptake reported with intracerebral tuberculomas. One of the earlier studies in this domain documented low-grade ^18^F-FDG uptake in CNS tuberculomas and toxoplasmosis [@R3]. In this study [@R3], the standardized uptake value ratio (lesion to contralateral brain area) in both of these conditions was significantly lower (range: 0.3--0.7) than that noted in patients with lymphoma (range: 1.7--3.1) with virtually no overlap of the uptake values. Contrary to this [@R3], in a recently reported case series studying intracranial tuberculomas [@R4], a relatively high lesion-to-normal gray matter uptake ratio was observed on both ^11^C-methionine (1.8±0.38) and ^18^F-FDG scans (1.64±0.26) in all newly diagnosed cases. The investigators concluded that ^11^C-methionine, similar to ^18^F-FDG, has limited specificity in distinguishing tuberculoma from neoplastic lesions [@R4].

Brain abscess is another differential diagnosis in which there is typically high uptake in the periphery of the lesion with reduced metabolic activity in the center. A similar pattern has been noted in a comparative study with both fluoroethyl tyrosine and ^18^F-FDG, which showed false-positive results in abscesses and in a case of acute demyelinating lesion [@R5]. Such an",853,11, uptake pattern in brain abscesses has also been documented

Last, but by no means least, I ended up in the Friends section. Opinions on this new range have been very divided, but at the end of the day, it's selling really well – I was told it's accounted for around 10% of all Lego sales since its launch. My daughter loves it and spent most of her Christmas money on four sets, so she was very excited when I brought her home a freebie pen with the logo on it – hey, she's only five! For the second half of the year there's another batch of about eight sets planned. Olivia, she of the inventor's workshop fame, loses a bit of geek-cred by having a speedboat and beach lounger set, Mia gains some cool by revealing that she's a drummer, and Andrea goes all fluffy with her bunny hutch. Two of the larger sets both feature horses in a big way, one with a campervan (though not as cool as the VW one) and horse trailer, and the biggest set being a show-jumping weekend camp, complete with bunk beds and a little toilet! The fabulous new colors are also being rolled out in the revamped ""Pink Brick"" boxes too. I'm sure these will continue to divide the audience and sell really well too. Oh, and they'll also be an advent calendar for them, which is great as that means we won't be fighting over one here!

Coming up are Yoda, Vader, Boba, Trooper and AT-AT variations, although I can't imagine any of them moving around as much 'in character' as R2 does. Maybe if they did a mouse droid?

3. iPieces from Jumbo Games

This is an interesting fusion of apps and board games. There are four packs of these molded play pieces covering four different games; Snakes and Ladders, Air Hockey, Game of Goose and a Fishing game. Their respective apps are free from the App Store and in reality the 'iPawns' included in each pack will work with any of the apps, which is handy as the £10 RRP is a bit pricey for what you get. I was given a set of the Snakes and Ladders one to try out which comes with four iPawns and two metal ladders.

Each time the game is started up, the ladders are snakes are randomly positioned and the snakes have a little animated and hissing sound effect attached to them. A roll of the on-screen dice and you're away up the grid. If you land on a ladder square you're prompted to place the ladder piece on the screen and move your iPawn to the top, if you land on a snake, it animates as you slide your iPawn down its back. It's a nice concept, but some of the apps still seem like Beta versions. The Snakes and Ladders doesn't keep track of the pieces or whose turn it is, just a fanfare when the Finish square is touched – which you can activate at any point and this also finishes the game which could be annoying if touched accidentally.

All the games are fun to play for 5 or 10 minutes – especially the Air Hockey, where the act of physically holding something lends it a slightly more real feel to it than just placing your finger on the screen.

MR. SPICER: All right, so number one, the first quote that you’re reading, if you actually go back, I was responding to — I was very clear that I said, “Based on what Chairman Nunes has said” — the following doesn’t make sense.

Q Okay, so within that —

MR. SPICER: But that’s an important part.

Q — I’m gathering that you’ve learned something new since then, so please tell us what you’ve learned.

MR. SPICER: Right, and again — no, no, no, because again, Major, I’ve commented on this both yesterday and today, that your obsession with who talked to whom and when is not the answer here. It should be the substance.

In the same way that when you guys print a story with 18 anonymous sources, your obsession is the substance, it seems now that you continue to look at from a backwards prism, which is, “What happened? Who drove in what gate? Who did they meet with? What were they wearing that day?” as opposed to, “What’s the underlying substance of this? Did something happen in the 2016 election? Did leaks occur?”

We are not going to engage actively in that kind of leaking that has been a problem. In fact, if you look at Obama’s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around, that they went around and did this. And she said, “That’s why there are so many leaks.”

They have admitted on the record that this was their goal — to leak stuff. And they literally — she said on the record “Trump’s team.” There are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it. And I think that’s really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets out.

Q But can’t the process, from your vantage point, validate the importance of the substance?

MR. SPICER: Well, I think there’s a review that we’ve asked for probably —

Q And you’ve told us that you’re willing to look into and ask questions about the process and provide us answers. That’s all I’m trying to —

MR. SPICER: No, no, no — no, don’t — please don’t put words in my mouth. I never said I would provide you answers. I said we would look into it.

The responsible thing for us to do is to provide the individuals and the committees who are doing the review the materials that they’re looking for — or some of them. We don’t know how many — what they’re exactly looking for, what they’ve seen, and what they haven’t.

Our goal is to be as forthright as possible. They asked the intelligence communities and others in a March letter for information. We are willing to provide them with the information that we have — the materials that we have come across. And I think that is an important step.

Again, it is not — our obligation is to make sure the review is done both in the House and the Senate as we asked for a few weeks ago, not to make sure that we illegally leak out information to you.

Q And when you say “we have information,” are you disputing the reports in the New York Times?

MR. SPICER: I’m not commenting on the reports, Major. I just got asked the same question.

320,0,26570,0,"Product market reforms are seen as a way to boost output in advanced economies, but we know little about their short-term impact. This column presents data from 18 advanced economies that reveal large differences in the potential upside of reform depending on the sector in which a firm operates, its size, and its financial health.

Given the secular decline in productivity growth and the weakness of the economic recovery in many advanced economies, increased attention is being paid to the potential role of structural reforms as a way to restore economic growth. The weak economic recovery partly reflects a lack of aggregate demand, but the global financial crisis has also undermined aggregate supply, notably through its impact on investment. The current economic situation should also be seen in the context of the secular slowdown in productivity growth that started well before the beginning of the Global Crisis, and which suggests that deeper structural forces are also important (IMF 2015, OECD 2015).

A lot of research has been done on the long-term benefits of competition-enhancing product market reforms (Boeri et al. 2015), relatively little is known about the short-term impacts of product market reforms across firms that differ in terms of the main sector in which they operate, the size of their operations, and their financial health. Understanding these effects may provide give us insights into how to design policy, the political economy of reforms, and the potential need for complementary policies. Our recent work provides a comprehensive analysis of the way these effects materialise over time, and how they differ across firms (Gal and Hijzen 2016).

We used internationally comparable firm-level data across 18 advanced economies from 1998 to 2013, based on the Orbis database provided by Bureau van Dijk, an electronic publishing firm. We considered ten regulated industries in three broad sectors: network industries, retail trade and professional services. These sectors have different technological characteristics, market structure, and product market regulation. Together they account for about a quarter of non-farm private sector employment, and an even larger part if we take account of their role as inputs for production in other parts of the economy.

To measure the restrictiveness of product market regulations, we make use of the OECD’s sector-level de jure product market regulation (PMR) indicators, complemented with an overview of major reforms based on a narrative approach (Duval et al. 2016). We document the short- to medium-term impact of product market reforms by estimating impulse-response functions for employment, capital and output using the local projection method (Jordà 2005, Teulings and Zubanov 2014).

Positive effects

Short-term, firm-level effects of product market reforms are positive, and strengthen over time (Figure 1). The effects are immediate for both output and investment, and increase to 4% and 3%, respectively, after two years. The effects for employment are considerably smaller and materialise only after two years. These results control for key firm characteristics, reforms in the two preceding or subsequent years, and many unobserved factors through a rich dummy structure that controls for country-industry specific trends, sector-specific technological developments, and country-specific macroeconomic conditions. The last control is particularly important since product market reforms often take place when economic conditions are weak. The results are robust to various approaches to identifying major reforms and a number of other sensitivity checks.

Size matters

There are also systematic and plausible differences in the effects of reforms across firms of different size across different industries (Figure 2). More specifically, in network industries, small firms tend to benefit most from pro-competitive product market reforms, while larger ones downsize to reduce costs and maintain market share. By contrast, in retail trade, large and potentially more efficient firms tend to benefit more from such reforms. These qualitative differences highlight important differences in the underlying mechanisms that create positive. These are due to differences in production technology, such as the degree of capital intensity and the nature of product market regulations. In particular, reforms in network industries aim for a simpler network access to potential service providers, thereby eroding the market power of established large firms. On the other hand, reforms in retail mostly concern easing restrictions on zoning and opening up additional plants, benefiting mainly larger, more productive",858,11," businesses.

322,0,20422,0,"2.1. Magnetic Separations in Biological Systems: General Considerations
The use of magnetic separations in biological systems as an alternative to gravitational or centrifugal separations has been reviewed [B. L. Hirschbein et al., Chemtech, March 1982:172-179 (1982); M. Pourfarzaneh, The Ligand Quarterly 5(1):41-47 (1982); and P. J. Halling and P. Dunnill, Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2:2-10 (1980)]. Several advantages of using magnetically separable particles as supports for biological molecules such as enzymes, antibodies and other bioaffinity adsorbents are generally recognized. For instance, when magnetic particles are used as solid phase supports in immobilized enzyme systems [see, e.g., P. J. Robinson et al., Biotech. Bioeng., XV:603-606 (1973)], the enzyme may be selectively recovered from media, including media containing suspended solids, allowing recycling in enzyme reactors. When used as solid supports in immunoassays or other competitive binding assays, magnetic particles permit homogeneous reaction conditions (which promote optimal binding kinetics and minimally alter analyte-adsorbent equilibrium) and facilitate separation of bound from unbound analyte, compared to centrifugation. Centrifugal separations are time-consuming, require expensive and energy-consuming equipment and pose radiological, biological and physical hazards. Magnetic separations, on the other hand, are relatively rapid and easy, requiring simple equipment. Finally, the use of non porous adsorbent-coupled magnetic particles in affinity chromatography systems allows better mass transfer and results in less fouling than in conventional affinity chromatography systems.
Although the general concept of magnetizing molecules by coupling them to magnetic particles has been discussed and the potential advantages of using such particles for biological purposes recognized, the practical development of magnetic separations has been hindered by several critical properties of magnetic particles developed thus far.
Large magnetic particles (mean diameter in solution greater than 10 microns(.mu.)) can respond to weak magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients; however, they tend to settle rapidly, limiting their usefulness for reactions requiring homogeneous conditions. Large particles also have a more limited surface area per weight than smaller particles, so that less material can be coupled to them. Examples of large particles are those of Robinson et al. [supra] which are 50-125.mu. in diameter, those of Mosbach and Anderson [Nature, 270:259-261 (1977)] which are 60-140.mu. in diameter and those of Guesdon et al. [J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 61(1):23-27 (1978)] which are 50-160.mu. in diameter. Composite particles made by Hersh and Yaverbaum [U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,997] comprise ferromagnetic iron oxide (Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4) carrier particles. The iron oxide carrier particles were reported to have diameters between 1.5 and 10.mu.. However, based on the reported settling rate of 5 minutes and coupling capacity of only 12 mg of protein per gram of composite particles [L. S. Hersh and S. Yaverbaum, Clin. Chim. Acta, 63:69-72 (1975)], the actual size of the composite particles in solution is expected to be substantially greater than 10.mu..
The Hersh and Yaverbaum ferromagnetic carrier particles of U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,997 are silanized with silanes capable of reacting with anti-digoxin antibodies to chemically couple the antibodies to the carrier particles. Various silane couplings are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,761, which is hereby incorporated by reference. That the diameters of the composite particles are probably greater than 10.mu. may be explained, at least in part, by the method of silanization employed in the Hersch and Yaverbaum patent. Procedures for silanization known in the art generally differ from each other in the media chosen for the polymerization of silane and its deposition on reactive surfaces. Organic solvents such as toluene [H. W. Weetall, in: Methods in Enzymology, K. Mosbach (ed.), 44:134-148, 140 (1976)], methanol [U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,997] and chloroform [U.S. Pat.

I waited some more. My eyes were still shut and I shifted uncomfortably on the old, rackety stool. Wait..Wasn’t the hat supposed to analyse your brain and actually speak to you? Sweat trickled down my forehead as I worried why it was taking so long.

What if I’m not magical? What if the letter wasn’t meant for me? Could have the owl got confused and delivered it to me accidently? But that doesn’t explain how I was able to move things suddenly without touching when I was angry or excited. I told myself to calm down and take a deep breath.

‘Then you would lose the bet,’ said a deep voice from my head and I almost fell off my chair. ‘I know you aren’t willing to work hard for things you don’t like.’

Then, I’m in Ravenclaw..?, I thought, taken aback by the Hat’s reaction.

‘No my child, you’re a born leader,’ said the Hat in a matter-of-fact tone, ‘and you’re destined to do great things.’

Me? Great things? The Hat’s got to be kidding me! I wasn’t talented nor was I hardworking! How was I going to be great?

But besides the pessimism, I felt a tiny spark of hope. Maybe I could finally shine and become successful.

After what seemed like ages again, the Sorting Hat spoke again, ‘Your journey will be hard but with all that determination and shrewdness in you, you’ll get through with flying colours.’

I gulped.

‘Good luck Ms Green’ said the Hat half amused.

I shuddered when it said my name but just a moment later,

‘S L Y T H E R I N!’

And this time, I did actually fall of the chair. I got up and Professor McGonagall picked the hat off my head.

I looked around at the Great Hall. There were four long tables with kids and teens from the ages 11 to 17 sitting on the benches staring at me. The Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and the Ravenclaws were shocked and some even pitiful. I looked at my left at the one last remaining house or MY house –Slytherin.

They looked disgusted and were shooting daggers at me.

‘Go ahead, join your house mates,’ said Professor McGonagall and gave me a nudge.

I nodded dumbly and walked down the stairs rather clumsily to the Slytherin table. I sat down on an empty seat beside a girl with wild black hair. Even before I could look at her, she got up, spat at me and walked away to sit beside a blonde girl further down the table.

I sighed and tried to ignore the different stares from people. An old man with a long pointed blue hat and equally long white beard cleared his throat. Every head turned to the headmaster’s direction and the Sorting Ceremony resumed.

‘Howard, Kimberly, ’ called out Professor McGonagall.

Just after about a few moments later, the tall pretty girl walked proudly over to the Gryffindor house table. The other Gryffindors were clapping wildly as they welcomed Kimberly to their house. The entire lot was sitting year wise and I looked at the first years. There were two girls, Kimberly and a pretty red-head whose name was Lily Evans and there was",884,11, one boy.

(1) Normal conditions -unstressed cells {#s1a}
---------------------------------------

Under normal cellular conditions ([Figure 1](#pone-0022038-g001){ref-type=""fig""}) there are very low levels of damaged/misfolded protein which are either refolded via the chaperone system or eliminated from the cell via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The majority of Hsf1 is bound to Hsp90 which prevents Hsf1 from becoming transcriptionally active. There is basal transcription of heat shock proteins to maintain pools at a steady state level but there is no upregulation of Hsps. JNK and p38 are maintained in their unphosphorylated state due to activity of the phosphatase Mkp1, which requires Hsp70 for its activity. Since there are sufficient pools of free Hsp70, apoptosis is inhibited. [Figure 1](#pone-0022038-g001){ref-type=""fig""} omits detail of JNK for clarity. (Note that [Figures 1](#pone-0022038-g001){ref-type=""fig""}, [2](#pone-0022038-g002){ref-type=""fig""}, [3](#pone-0022038-g003){ref-type=""fig""} are biological diagrams that summarise the key components of the model. A diagram of the full model network is shown in [Figure S1](#pone.0022038.s001){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}).

![Network structure of model for unstressed cells.\
Under normal conditions, free pools of Hsp70 and Hsp90 are high and pools of misfolded protein are low. Hsp90 is bound to Hsf1 to prevent transcription of heat shock genes. Hsp70 activates Mkp1 which leads to dephosphorylation of JNK and p38, so that apoptotic pathways are not activated. Thickness of lines indicates most likely reactions and states.](pone.0022038.g001){#pone-0022038-g001}

![Network structure of model for low or moderate levels of stress.\
Under conditions of low or moderate stress, pools of misfolded protein increase and bind to Hsp70 and Hsp90 in competition with other substrates. This leads to increased pools of Hsf1 which can now form trimers. The trimers are then activated resulting in transcription of Hsps. Since pools of Hsp70 are increased, there is still sufficient Hsp70 to prevent apoptosis.](pone.0022038.g002){#pone-0022038-g002}

![Network structure of model for high levels of stress.\
Under conditions of high or prolonged stress, high levels of misfolded protein may overwhelm the chaperone system. Although upregulation of Hsps takes place, pools of Hsp70 may be insufficient to activate Mkp1 and so there is a high probability that apoptosis will take place.](pone.0022038.g003){#pone-0022038-g003}

(2) Low -- moderate levels of stress {#s1b}
------------------------------------

When cells are stressed ([Figure 2](#pone-0022038-g002){ref-type=""fig""}), damaged/misfolded proteins accumulate and bind to Hsp70 and Hsp90. Once bound to chaperones, they may be refolded or sent for degradation. Binding of misfolded proteins to chaperones also prevents their aggregation. Due to competition from misfolded proteins, Hsf1 is released from Hsp90 and its concentration is now sufficient for it to form trimers. Hsf1 trimers are phosphorylated and become transcriptionally active so Hsps are upregulated. Hsp70 also binds to a phosphatase (currently unknown and so is referred to as PPX) which will dephosphorylate the trimers. This occurs when the concentration of free Hsp70 is sufficiently high and provides a negative feedback loop to prevent further upregulation of Hsps when they are present in sufficient number. This also provides a mechanism to switch off transcription of Hsps once the stress is over. There is sufficient Hsp70, despite some of the pool binding to misfolded protein, to continue to keep Mkp1 active and so prevent apoptosis.

When Ava stumbles into Paradise and comes face-to-face with her dream man, she has a feeling she’s standing on the precipice of something life-changing. Not to mention, she couldn’t be more surprised to learn her supposedly prim and proper aunt Julie was actually part owner of the premier sex club in Miami and a top-notch Dominatrix.

Navy SEAL Logan Turner always knew he needed more out of life than the next mission. That’s why he opened Paradise with his best friend Julie. It didn’t hurt that he could reap the benefits of owning a BDSM sex club. But when a sexy, doe-eyed woman walks in, his control slips for the first time ever.

Maggie's Longing

Who would have thought a plan to get the attention of one man, would have Maggie Blake taking two men to her bed?

Maggie Blake has one desire, to experience what the way too sexy Brian O'Malley has to offer in bed. Too bad he thinks of her as an annoyance and not as the hot, willing woman she is.

Brian O'Malley has one rule in life. Never let a woman too close, but club Paradise's sassy little bartender threatens to change that rule and wiggle her hot little ass into his damaged heart.

Julie's Surrender

Mistress Julie has worked to gain control of her life and overcome a tragedy from her past, and as a co-owner of Paradise, Miami’s premier BDSM club, she thought she had everything. But the truth is she longs for something more—something like the happiness her closest friends have found with their new partners.

Nick’s sexual specialty is playing “guest star” as the third in his friends’ ménage encounters. He’s especially good at reading a situation and adjusting accordingly, and giving and receiving pleasure—and then moving on. But once he meets Julie, Nick begins to rethink his ideas on relationships.

Nick and Julie get along great outside the bedroom, but Nick will need all his skills at discerning a woman’s deepest desires to show Julie that what she thinks she wants isn’t exactly what she needs.

Logan Turner walked into Paradise. The smell of booze and sex flowed over him, comforting his raw nerves. He scanned the large space and noticed the paint changes and new furnishings. The last time Logan was home, he and his business partner, Julie, discussed the updates this place needed. He liked the contrast of red paint and black leather furniture.

His gaze landed on the pretty little bartender and club manager. Her small, heart-shaped ass wiggled to whatever music beat through her earbuds.

“Hey, Maggie, I like what you did with the place,” he called out, loud enough for her to hear him.

The glass she washed clattered into the sink and Maggie spun. The look of surprise on her attractive face had Logan biting back a chuckle.

“Oh, Logan, you scared me.”

She wiped her palms on a bar rag, pushed her pink bangs out of her eyes and rushed over to him. He enveloped her fairy-sized body into a friendly hug.

“I’m glad you’re home,” she said against his chest.

In 1978, they did an alternate version of the title song for The Return of the Saint TV show starring Ian Ogilvy. Their song ""Taking It Easy"" was used in the European versions of the show, where another version was used in English-speaking countries.

They are also known for their work on animated series, having composed original songs for Italian-dubbed anime (such as Doraemon, Ashita no Joe and Galaxy Express 999) and European series (such as Around the World with Willy Fog). They also composed the music for the cartoon series Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds and Bobobobs.

Later years: Withdrawal from music and comeback

By the early 1990s the brothers had become disillusioned with the music business in general and in particular by their almost systematic lack of recognition as professional composers in Italy (although they were mantaining a solid fan base outside of their homeland). As a result of this, they decided to slowly withdraw from music composition and performance in order to move into the more behind-the-scenes, but also more profitable business of production of television series and films. During this period, the duo kept their musical output to the bare minimum, often limiting themselves to scores and soundtracks for their own television and cinematic productions, some of which were mainly composed and arranged by Maurizio (the duo's most musically active member) on his own, with his older brother Guido only providing basic melodic ideas; they still managed to score sizeable audience hits in the area of production, with long running drama/romantic series such as Elisa di Rivombrosa and Incantesimo (among several others), broadcast for several seasons respectively by Mediaset and RAI.

The first hint of their long-awaited return to music came in November 2007, when they performed their first concert as Oliver Onions in 25 years, at the Lucca Comics Festival. Nine years later, in July 2016, Hungarian music promoter and impresario Gàbor Kóves asked them to put on an Oliver Onions ""reunion"" and perform their greatest hits live on stage, backed by a rock band and a full orchestra, in an one-off concert event meant both as a celebration of their career and a tribute to their then-recently departed friend Bud Spencer. According to Maurizio De Angelis's account of the episode in the liner notes for the 2017 audio/video release of the event, Kóves persuaded them to perform in Budapest by demostrating them how popular they still were in Hungary, showing them a large number of fan pages, both on Facebook and on the Internet in general, created by local fans as a tribute to them and to Spencer & Hill films. Maurizio also admitted that he and Guido were initially very reluctant to perform live, as they had not done so for many years and felt rusty and unprepared; in particular, Guido was utterly terrified at the prospect of singing lead vocals live, as he had been almost completely uninvolved in music for a very long time - having engaged himself only in film production. Still, the brothers decided to apply an old Italian proverb (known locally as the ""Bicycle Rule""), which states that ""Once you have learned how to ride a bicycle, you never forget"". By applying that rule, they came back on their musical feet within one week of intensive studio rehearsals and, once they were actually reunited as musicians, the adrenaline rush was such that Guido managed to overcome his fears and apply the ""Bicycle Rule"" to himself as well. The event was hugely successful, both locally and elsewhere. Subsequently, it spawned a series of short but intense tours of Italy and Europe in",802,11," the following years, all billed as Oliver Onions Is"

The film was released on 15 January 2003 and was an super hit at the box office. It was also dubbed in Telugu as Maa Bava Bangaram.

Plot
Muthu (Vijayakanth) lives in a village with his sister Maragatham (Uma). Muthu is very fond of his sister and ready to do anything for her. Pavazham (Soundarya) is an orphan who lives in the same village. Muthu and Pavazham have a liking towards each other. Ponnambalam is the local baddie who tries to molest Pavazham when she is alone. However, Muthu comes for rescue and takes Pavazham along with him to his house.

Maragatham is married to Sundaram (Prakash Raj). Sundaram’s sister Gowri’s (Swathi) wedding is also arranged. But on the day of Gowri’s wedding, her fiance passes away which makes the villagers believe that Gowri is unlucky. Sundaram’s family members want Muthu to marry Gowri, but Muthu refuses as he is in love with Pavazham. Angered by this, Sundaram’s family members kick out Maragatham from their house as a means of revenge. Maragatham comes back to Muthu’s house.

Muthu tries hard to get Gowri’s wedding fixed again, but in vain. He meets Akash with a wedding proposal, but is turned down by his parents. Meanwhile, Maragatham is conceived. Sundaram understands Muthu’s situation and visits Maragatham frequently without informing his family members. Finally, Sundaram finds a bride groom for Gowri and their wedding is arranged. Sundaram also brings Maragatham to his house and the families are united.

Radiofrequency transmissions are also regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which controls the frequencies that may be used by individuals. Radiofrequency transmissions are also susceptible to interference and produce noise.
In contrast to RF communications, light sources used for communication are extremely secure due to the fact that they are focused within a narrow beam, requiring placement of equipment within the beam itself for interception. Also, because the visible spectrum is not regulated by the FCC, light sources can be used for communications purposes without the need of a license. Light sources are also not susceptible to interference nor do they produce noise that can interfere with other devices.
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) may be used as light sources for data transmission, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,879,263 and 7,046,160, the entire contents of each being expressly incorporated herein by reference. LEDs have a quick response to “ON” and “OFF” signals, as compared to the longer warm-up and response times associated with fluorescent lighting, for example. LEDs are also efficient in producing light, as measured in lumens per watt. Recent developments in LED technology, such as high brightness blue LEDs, which in turn paved the way for white LEDs, have made LEDs a practical alternative to conventional light sources. As such, LED technology provides a practical opportunity to combine lighting and communication. This combination of lighting and communication allows ubiquitous light sources such as street lights, home lighting, and office building lighting, for example, to be converted to, or supplemented with, LED technology to provide for communications while simultaneously producing light for illumination purposes.
Regarding office buildings, building management is a complex science which incorporates and governs all facets of human, mechanical and structural systems associated with buildings. As a result of the complexity, most commercial buildings are managed by commercial property management companies with great expertise.

The effects of depletion type, diagnosis, depletion type-by-diagnosis and time on the ΔHAMD, ΔMADRS and ΔBAI scores were assessed with linear mixed models with an autoregressive covariance structure. Subject number and depletion sequence were included as random effects in all models. In addition, the factor gender was included in all models to regress-out this possible confounder since there were significantly more male subjects in the TD study. Furthermore, a *post hoc* analysis involving only the females alone was performed to prove that the statistical analysis adequately controlled for the gender difference. *Post hoc* *t*-tests involved a Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. Additional analyses assessed the different items measured with the HAMD, the MADRS and the BAI in detail using *t*-tests in rMDD to test for differences between TD and CD across symptom dimensions. The significance thresholds for these contrasts were set at alpha=0.05, two tailed. SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses. The means of the data are reported with their associated s.e.

PET imaging
-----------

The PET imaging methods have been described in detail in our previous reports on the same participant cohort.^[@bib27],\ [@bib28]^ Both studies used the same procedures with respect to PET imaging. The PET images were acquired when the peak behavioral response was expected, that is, in the TD study, PET was measured 6 h after the administration of the amino-acid mixture/placebo, because the peak effects were expected at 5--7 h; in the CD study, PET images were acquired 30 h after the administration of the first AMPT/placebo dose, which corresponded to the time period when peak behavioral response was expected.^[@bib3]^ Scanning was performed with a GE Advance scanner in three-dimensional mode (35 contiguous slices, 4.25 mm thick; three-dimensional resolution=6 mm full-width at half-maximum; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a slow bolus (over 2 min) injection of ^18^FDG. In order to obviate the need for arterial blood sampling, cerebral glucose utilization was quantified using a method that combines the left ventricular chamber time--tissue radioactivity data that were measured with dynamic PET imaging of the heart with venous blood sampling in order to provide ^18^FDG input function.^[@bib30]^ This method has been validated previously by comparing it to more invasive approaches that use arterial plasma sampling.^[@bib30]^ During image processing, the left ventricular time--radioactivity curve was extended in time to include the time of the brain emission scan by obtaining venous blood samples 25, 30, 35 and 50 min after the ^18^FDG injection. The mean radioactivity of these samples was divided by the mean left ventricular radioactivity concentration between 25 and 35 min post injection. This ratio was used to scale the 50-min venous sample concentration, which then was appended to the left ventricular curve in order to complete the input function that was used to generate parametric images of the regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglu), as described by Moore *et al.*^[@bib30]^ To provide an anatomical framework for the analysis of the PET images, structural MRI scans were acquired with a 3.0-T scanner (Signa; GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI, USA) applying a three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo sequence (echo time 2.982 ms; repetition time 7.5 ms; inversion time 725 ms; voxel size 0.9 × 0.9 × 1.2 mm).

PET imaging: region-of-interest analysis
----------------------------------------

To compare the effects of TD versus placebo with CD versus placebo on cerebral metabolism, first a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis (with *P*-values corrected for the number of ROIs), and then a voxelwise analysis (with *P*-values corrected for the number of independent comparisons across the entire brain) were performed. For the ROI analysis, MEDx (Medical Numerics, Sterling, VA, USA) software was used. ROIs were selected according to previous results in rMDD^[@bib5],\ [@bib31]^ and untreated, symptomatic patients",979,11," with MDD,^[@bib32]"

As good as we think we are at writing we all have our share
of rejections. Some of those rejections need to be rejected because it is bad, but
there are also rejections where the writer has not set a foot wrong, grammar is
perfect, context is there, and the article is perfect. When you see an article
in the rejected column and no reason is given and you have spent two hours on a
700 word article, is it fair just to reject? One client told me, I love your article,
but you didn’t say his or her. Another one commented like this: don’t like.
Well, they can all then claim ‘don’t like’ and be off to the next writer and
repeat the same thing.

A client can have eight or ten writers and reject every
single article; no one is going to question it. My thought is something like
this: what’s to stop the client from taking your article, say no to you, then
give all your rejected articles to one of his or her own writers to rewrite? He
would only pay a rewrite fee to his writer and we would lose our fee and all
the time we spent researching information.

I have had two writers over the past year write to me and
say that they have seen part of my work stolen and in someone else’s article.
iWriter is a great site, but I don’t believe that writers can be seen to do all
this word grinding and the company not taking any measures to monitor the site
to stop clients reject some articles for no reason at all. The first week I
started at iWriter I wrote several pieces for a client and he wrote to me that
he would like to have me write for him as he liked my style. I got the whole
batch of six or seven articles. I wrote three articles for which I got paid but
when I came to the fourth and fifth article I didn’t see his name on any of the
listed articles. I wrote the remaining articles thinking he was sick or
something. I have not seen his name since, although I believe he is still there
under another name.

7 tips to save on auto insurance

1Do all your
insurance business with one company. As a business owner you will probably have
many policies and whether for auto insurance, commercial insurance or any other
kind of insurance have them under one roof so that you become used to your
agent and can establish a relationship with him to take care of your needs. Buy
both your home and auto insurance from the same company as you will get a
discount, sometimes up to 10%.

2Ask your
secretary to go online and get five or more quotes from different insurance
companies so you can compare costs and get all the cover you need for an
affordable price. When the agent you are working with knows that you are
comparing costs he will in all likelihood scour the policy terms and conditions
for a better rate. Have all your policies under one umbrella.

3Follow the rules
of the road and do not speed. Speeding tickets can pile up and jack up your
premiums. This is not something people really take into consideration.

4Increase your
deductible on the vehicle as this can reduce your insurance premium by 5% to 10%.

5Park your vehicle
in the areas assigned for the public and do not park in front of hydrants,
loading zones and blocking emergency slots as you will be ticketed for them.

JSONObject from dot seperated strings

I am struggling with a specific problem, that I cannot think of correctly. The following is the problem
I have a map with key value like the following, i just used strings here
String key = ""activate.message.success""

String key1 = ""activate.title""
String value1 = ""Good Title""
String key2 = ""activate.message.error""
String value2 = ""error""

I need to build a json like the following
{
  ""activate"":{
       ""message"":{
         ""success"":""success"",
         ""error"":""error"",

I could not think of a proper solution for this use case and struggling for 3 hours. I thought of using recursion, but i dont how exactly i could do. Please help with this. I am using java for this, I should use generic JSONObject to solve as there is not POJO mappings.

It wasn’t until I started being open and honest about my own journey that I realized just how misconstrued the term “self-love” is. At first I was really thrown off by some of the reactions I encountered, to the point where I even started to second guess myself and my decisions, but eventually I learned to stop taking offense. I came to the conclusion that any benighted response I was met with was just a lack of understanding on the person’s part and I have since done my best to educate, whenever necessary, on the true motivations behind a self-love journey.

To this day, I get a lot of comments like “What does that even mean?” and “I don’t really get what you’re trying to do here” and “Are you just tired of dating or something?” (Um, yeah, but that’s not the point).

My personal favorite though, and the one that I’m faced with most, is what I believe to be the absolute culmination of all ignorant thoughts and attitudes towards the self-love movement: “Isn’t that the world’s problem, that people love themselves too much and others too little? It just seems really selfish to me.”

Now, because I have personally grown a lot on this journey, it’s much easier today than it was in the beginning to control the intense eruption of emotions that I would feel at this accusation: the accusation that I am, and that anyone else who pursues self-love is, in fact selfish for taking the time to heal. All of the things that I would want to say in reply to this notion, some less eloquent and less gracious than others, can be simply sum up by saying: False. SO false.

This infuriating stigma stems from those who confuse, quite inaccurately, selfish love",410,11," with self-love. And let me be clear,"
346,0,29561,0,"On Monday, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough warned that Democrats might lose in November, because despite President Trump’s unpopularity among many, the president has achieved many conservative goals.

“The question Democrats should be asking themselves today is whether Trump’s expanding populist checklist will energize the conservative base in November enough to keep his congressional handmaidens in charge,” Scarborough wrote. “Unless Democrats find their voice and an alternative to Trump’s bleak agenda, his pathetic populist shtick might just do the trick this fall.”

Scarborough claims to be a Republican, and he once represented the GOP in Congress, but liberal slant dominated every word of this Washington Post column. Even so, the MSNBC host discovered a very pertinent point: Trump has been delivering on conservative policies far more than the #AntiTrump Republicans anticipated. Not all of the president’s achievements are “populist,” but they will resonate among conservatives in November.

The MSNBC host essentially accused Republicans of selling their souls for Donald Trump. While it seemed at first like they had gained little in return, Scarborough had the vision to admit that the “blundering billionaire has actually begun to fill his political trophy case with victories sure to inspire the conservative base.”

Republican candidates justifying their support for Trump can point to many concrete achievements. “For starters, they can point to Trump’s conservative judicial nominees beyond [Supreme Court Justice Neil] Gorsuch as cause for celebration,” Scarborough admitted. The list actually proved quite expansive.

Their “talking points can also include massive tax cuts, a bigger military budget, regulatory reform and the gutting of the Environmental Protection Agency,” the MSNBC host noted. “Other wedge-issue winners include the planned withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, scrapping of the Iran nuclear deal, undermining Obamacare, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, attacking federal employee unions and promoting extreme immigration policies. Add to that the mocking of political correctness and identity politics, and you have a platform sure to inspire the activists who drive today’s Republican Party.”

To be clear, the MSNBC host does not support any (?) of these policies. He merely admits that they might play well to many voters in November. “While many of these policies will drive up the federal debt and diminish U.S. power across the globe, and will likely be reversed by a stroke of his successor’s pen, Trump’s list of ‘accomplishments’ are scratching an ideological itch that establishment Republicans could never reach,” Scarborough wrote.

As if his attack on these policies were not clear enough, he emphasized that these things would “prove to be disastrous in short order.”

“But Trump is not concerned with history’s judgment,” the self-assured fake Republican liberal proudly wrote. “He simply wants to stay out of jail and complete his first term.”

Stay out of jail? Oh right, Scarborough thinks the president should be in jail for “colluding” with the Russians. For the MSNBC host, Donald John Trump is the devil.

While Scarborough deserves credit for admitting that Democrats are in trouble, he only came to this conclusion after many paragraphs of lambasting Trump.

“It has been hard to grasp why so many conservatives would sell their political souls to a man who wallows in racist stereotypes, questions federal judges’ legitimacy, flogs the free press, undermines Madison’s constitutional norms, declares war on America’s intelligence community, and attacks Justice Department and FBI leaders he appointed for refusing to kill special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation,” the MSNBC host wrote. Some of those criticisms are genuine, but most are ridiculous overstatements: “flogs the free press”? Really?

Even in his paragraph opening up the idea that Trump has accomplishments to present to conservative voters, Scarborough got in a few jabs at the president: “",850,11,Republican candidates justifying their support for a man who lies about

The Melnā Piektdiena club (literally ""The Black Friday"" in Latvian) is a cult, underground, heavy, and extreme music concert venue in Riga, Latvia. Over the years, it has hosted shows by some of the most respected artists within a variety of genres, including bands such as: Sepultura, Soulfly, Fear Factory, Meshuggah, Hypocrisy, Cannibal Corpse, Kreator, Converge, Obituary, Type O Negative, Nile, Rotting Christ, Children of Bodom, Napalm Death, and Death in June, among others.

History
The venue grew out of the legendary series of Black Friday concerts, which have been held in Riga since the early 1990s, whenever the 13th day of a month falls on a Friday. A series of Latvian metal music compilation CDs were released under the name of the club. Since the same promoters staged the metal shows and produced the compilation records, they decided to use an already established name for the CDs. The club is located in an industrial area, between the railway and RVR factory, at 193c Brīvības Street, close to central Riga.

The club opened on Friday, May 13, 2006, with a show by the leading Latvian, technical, death metal band Neglected Fields whose front man, Sergejs ""Destruction"" Kustovs, became a co-owner of the venue. Since its first event, Melnā Piektdiena has become the linchpin of the Latvian metal music scene.

Despite its official capacity of only 666 guests (which can be updated to 1000 concertgoers if the bar and smoking area capacities are counted in), the cult reputation of the club attracts world-famous foreign metal bands, as well as local and Baltic musicians. The club also embraces other genres of music, including gothic, progressive rock, electronic, and industrial music among others.

Notable performers
The following list might be incomplete. Some of the bands mentioned below have played Melnā Piektdiena more than once.

2006
Carpathian Forest, Keep of Kalessin, Hate, Danny Cavanagh, Moonspell, and To/Die/For played, plus shows with local bands were held. A series of concerts called InnerFade was launched.

2007
Napalm Death, Cannibal Corpse, Type O Negative, Krisiun, Týr, Samael, Rotting Christ, Leaves' Eyes, Atrocity, Decapitated, Incantation, Marduk, Chthonic), and Antimatter, among others, played.

2008
Obtest, Soilwork, Overkill, Anal Cunt, Dark the Suns, Negură Bunget, Paul Gilbert, Vader, Grave, Immolation, Melechesh, Enslaved, Metsatöll, Excrementory Grindfuckers, and Emilie Autumn, among others, appeared.

2009
Kreator, Caliban, Eluveitie, Richie Kotzen, Shining, Blaze Bayley, Chimaira, Unearth, Throwdown, and Dååth played. An Anthrax concert was planned, but did not happen because the band cancelled their entire European tour due to a change of vocalists.
Local traditions were continued, such as the Fresh Blood band battle. The first Under the Black Metal Siege event was organized by Dark Domination.

2010
Dark Funeral, Nargaroth, Carach Angren, Brian «Head» Welch of Korn, Despised Icon, Winds of Plague, Parkway Drive, Torture Killer, 50 Lions, Sadist, Nokturnal Mortum, Sabaton, Alestorm, Therion, and Loch Vostok appeared. 
A summer mini-fest was announced at the club in July headlined by Napalm Death and featuring Black Cobra, Weedeater, Saviours and Caliban, along with other acts. The festival was a stripped-down version of the Open Air Metalshow previously held annually at Blome near Smiltene town in the Vidzeme region; by 2010 the economic crisis had severely hurt Latvia, and the promoters could not afford a full-scale major event. The smaller festival, held in and around the Melnā Piektdiena venue, proved even more unsuccessful, nearly dragging the club into bankruptcy. The Midsummer Metal Fest has been discontinued in Latvia since then.

2011
Combichrist, Mortiis, Obituary, Sacramental, Nile, Onslaught, Suidakra, Gods Tower, and Amorphis played Melnā Piektdiena for the first time, as well as many returning bands.

351,0,25241,2050," cluster $\alpha$ includes the cluster of size zero, which have $m_{\alpha} \phi_{\alpha} = 1$. Alternatively, (\[eq:cluster\_expansion1\]) can be written in a more explicitly form, $$q(\bm{\sigma}) = J_{0} + \sum_{\alpha} m_{\alpha} J_{\alpha} \phi_{\alpha},
\label{eq:cluster_expansion2}$$ where $J_0$ is the ECI of an empty cluster while $\alpha$ in this case corresponds to the clusters of size one and higher. It is often more practical and convenient to express the ECI per atom rather than per occurrence [@Zhang2016], in which case $m_{\alpha}$ and $J_{\alpha}$ are combined into one term, $\widetilde{J}_{\alpha}= m_{\alpha}J_{\alpha}$ and (\[eq:cluster\_expansion1\]) becomes $$q(\bm{\sigma}) = \sum_{\alpha} \widetilde{J}_{\alpha} \phi_{\alpha}.
\label{eq:cluster_expansion3}$$ CLEASE uses the ECI per atom ($\widetilde{J}_{\alpha}$), but interested users can determine the value of $J_{\alpha}$ based on the values of $m_{\alpha}$ and $\widetilde{J}_{\alpha}$.

Theoretically, there is an infinite number of terms in (\[eq:cluster\_expansion3\]) for an infinite crystal, and the resulting expression can represent any scalar function $q(\bm{\sigma})$ given that appropriate ECI values are found. In practice, sufficient accuracy is often reached with clusters with small number of atoms (e.g., one-, two- and three-body clusters) that are relatively compact in size (e.g., 5 to 7 Å in diameter).

Cluster Selection & Determination of ECI Values
-----------------------------------------------

A crucial element of CE approach is to select relevant clusters from a theoretically infinite number of possible clusters. Many multicomponent systems yield thousands of clusters even when the expansion is limited to relatively compact size and small number of atoms, and they are vastly truncated since only a small fraction of them is needed to achieve the required accuracy. Determining the optimal set of clusters that minimizes the number of clusters without losing its predictive power has been a topic of keen interest in the past decade [@Zarkevich2004; @Blum2005; @Hart2005; @Diaz-Ortiz2007; @Lerch2009], and the cluster selection based on genetic algorithms [@Blum2005; @Hart2005; @Lerch2009] was considered to be the most robust method.

More recently, the use of compressive sensing [@Nelson2013a] was proposed to efficiently select the clusters and determine their ECIs in one shot. The compressive sensing is based on $\ell_1$ norm (a special case of $\ell_p$ norm",676,11," where $p = 1$), which is defined as"

For visual surveillance applications, the virtual cameras are fixed on the roadside or at intersections. The experiments are conducted to verify that the artificial scenes are repeatable and that the camera’s position, height, and orientation can be configured flexibly.

Onboard Camera
--------------

In this experiment, an onboard camera is configured at a height of 2 meters, mimicking the camera installed on the vehicle roof. There are totally 67 vehicles on the road, including 52 vehicles parking on the roadside (3 buses, 4 trucks, and 45 cars ) and another 15 vehicles in motion. We turn the camera orientation from left to right and get five orientations (i.e., -30, -15, 0, 15, and 30 degrees with respect to the lane direction). The distance between two cameras on adjacent lanes is 5 meters. These configurations lead to substantial changes in object appearance. Fig. 7 shows three continuous images captured by the onboard camera.

2020 mustang gt500 price - horsepower, interior, exhaust, engine, convertible, conversion and review - Ford continues to provide slow information with the future of GT500. As well as the Bronco teaser picture that was released recently, we haven't received much here, but we have an idea of how the GT500 display style from the front. News GT500 officially started in January, when Ford released a short video with two facts about: horsepower 700-plus and 2019 arrival. With the current Mustang models for many years in the future, I bet that create new GT500 model of 2020. I also speculated that Ford would use a turbocharger in combination with the new version of the V-8 engine with 5.2 liters of GT350 to get the number of 700-plus horsepower. 2020 mustang gt500 price - And now that the Mustang, which now has a more sophisticated rear suspension and independent rear axle instead of a long-held, we hope that GT500 will eventually have hand bars to customize with incredible power.

As far as the new picture is concerned, it's a bunch of grids. Mustang Shelby GT500, in modern times, always requires a lot of air, both for the engine and for cooling. The 2013 model runs without the grid, the air flow requirement is immense. In addition to the large aperture on the model (which should have a cross-sectional bumper there), we can see a strong outline with a separate visual bodywork of the headlights. And, of course, it's not the front logo and the Big Snake Center, which ensures that you recognize this Mustang as it flew past you.

2020 Mustang GT500 Price

It's clearly too soon to talk about the cost, however the 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 could be the most costly form of the sixth era Mustang and produces about $70,000. Moreover, there is news that Ford intends to build in a limited number, which can be translated into the costs of an agency that",415,11," does not make sense.

356,0,26696,0,"This invention relates to the application of a diffusion aluminide coating on a surface, and in particular, to the application of such a coating from an aluminum-containing paint.
In an aircraft gas turbine (jet) engine, air is drawn into the front of the engine, compressed by a shaft-mounted compressor, and mixed with fuel. The mixture is burned, and the hot exhaust gases are passed through a turbine mounted on the same shaft. The flow of combustion gas turns the turbine by impingement against an airfoil section of the turbine blades and vanes, which turns the shaft and provides power to the compressor and fan. In a more complex version of the gas turbine engine, the compressor and a high pressure turbine are mounted on one shaft, and the fan and low pressure turbine are mounted on a separate shaft. The hot exhaust gases flow from the back of the engine, driving it and the aircraft forward.
The hotter the combustion and exhaust gases, the more efficient is the operation of the jet engine. There is thus an incentive to raise the combustion and exhaust gas temperatures. The maximum temperature of the combustion gases is normally limited by the materials used to fabricate the turbine vanes and turbine blades of the turbine, upon which the hot combustion gases impinge. In current engines, the turbine vanes and blades are made of nickel-based superalloys, and can operate at temperatures of up to about 1900-2150xc2x0 F.
Many approaches have been used to increase the operating temperature limits of turbine blades, turbine vanes, and other hot-section components to their current levels. In one such approach, the article is protected by a diffusion aluminide protective coating with an optional ceramic thermal barrier coating overlying the protective coating.
During service, the portions of the hot-section components that are exposed to the most severe conditions of temperature and environment are sometimes damaged so that some of the underlying material is lost, thereby changing the dimensions of the hot-section component and adversely affecting its functionality. When such damage is detected, the damaged article is removed from service. If the damage is not too extreme, the damaged article may be repaired and later returned to service.
When the article is repaired, the protective coating and the thermal barrier coating may be removed, and the damaged region is built up by welding. A new protective coating and new thermal barrier coating may be deposited to complete the repair.
The removal of the entire protective coating and thermal barrier coating, and the deposition of new coatings, is an expensive and time-consuming process. For some types of repairs, it would be desirable to leave these coatings in place in those areas which are not being repaired, so that only the repaired area would be recoated. However, this partial recoating is not possible with the existing approach for applying the diffusion aluminide protective coating.
There is accordingly a need for an improved approach to applying a protective coating to hot-section components of gas turbine engines and comparable articles, which permits partial removal of the protective coating and partial recoating. The present invention fulfills this need, and further provides related advantages.
The present invention provides a technique for applying a diffusion aluminide coating to a surface of an article such as a nickel-base superalloy. The coating is performed by painting techniques from a paint composition that is distinct from a slurry that contains a halide activator. Upon heating, the coating proceeds by a condensed-phase (solid or liquid) reaction. There is substantially no gaseous phase beyond ordinary vapor pressure that can coat those portions of the article which are desirably not coated. Vapor-phase masking of these portions that are not to be coated is not required during heating, although paint masking may be used during application of the coating precursor paint in the same manner as conventional painting.
A method for coating an article includes providing an article to be coated such as a gas turbine component made of a nickel-base superalloy. A coating precursor paint comprising aluminum-containing pigment particles, a temporary thin-film-forming binder comprising an organic resin such as an acrylic, and a solvent for the temporary binder is prepared. The coating precursor paint is applied to a surface of the article, and thereafter the coating precursor paint is heated to a temperature of from about 1200xc2x0 F. to about 2100xc2x0 F. in a non-oxidizing environment. The heating step may be performed in vacuum, a non-oxidizing atmosphere such as an inert gas, or in a low partial pressure of oxygen gas in some cases.
The aluminum-containing pigment particles may be substantially pure aluminum. In another embodiment, the aluminum-containing pigment particles may comprise aluminum and at least one other alloying element selected from group consisting of platinum, hafnium, zirconium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium,",1001,11," chromium, palladium, silicon, nickel, cob"

An inveterate funder of leftist causes around the world, and paymaster of the US Democratic Party, Soros is often seen as the puppet master of the Obama Administration and responsible for many of the problems that beset the West.

While I have no doubt that Soros is every bit as malevolent as his opponents paint him, I think it is dangerous to assume that he is at the top of the of the anti American food chain.

It is important to know if Barack Obama works for George Soros, but even more vital to understand who George Soros may work for.

There is no doubt that Soros has heavily promoted communist and socialist causes in several countries. Is that because Soros hates America so much, that he is willing fund its enemies? Or is it because Soros himself is part of a very much alive, but low profile communist apparatus?

Let’s look at that possibility.

Commentators have pointed out that in order for George Soros to have achieved what he did in his early days, he must have been favored by the communists. The following observations have been made by prominent Czech former dissident leader Petr Cibulka.

359,0,23534,0,"The present invention is directed to an equalizer that substantially eliminates ghosts in signals processed by a receiver.
Ghosts are produced in a receiver usually because a signal arrives at the receiver through different transmission paths. For example, in a system having a single transmitter, the multipath transmission of a signal may occur because of signal reflection. That is, the receiver receives a transmitted signal and one or more reflections of the transmitted signal. As another example, the multipath transmission of a signal may occur in a system having plural transmitters that transmit signals to the same receiver using the same carrier frequency. A network which supports this type of transmission is typically referred to as a single frequency network.
When a signal reaches a receiver through two or more different transmission paths, an interference pattern results. In the frequency domain, this interference pattern is manifested by a variable signal amplitude along the frequency axis. The worst case interference pattern results when the ghost is 100% and is shown in FIG. 1. This interference pattern has amplitude nulls or near amplitude nulls at certain frequencies. Therefore, any information contained in the received signal at these frequencies is likely lost because the signal to noise ratio near these frequencies is below a usable threshold.
A variety of systems have been devised to deal with the problems caused by ghosts. For example, spread spectrum systems deal very adequately with the problem of a 100% ghost by spreading the transmitted data over substantial bandwidth. Accordingly, even though a 100% ghost means that some information may be lost at the frequencies corresponding to amplitude nulls, a data element can still be recovered because of the high probability that it was spread over frequencies which do not correspond to amplitude nulls. Unfortunately, the data rate R associated with spread spectrum systems is typically too low for many applications. (The data rate R is defined as the number of data bits per Hertz of channel bandwidth.)
It is also known to use a matched filter in a receiver in order to deal with the problem of a ghost. In this approach, data is transmitted as a data vector. The matched filter correlates the received data with reference vectors corresponding to the possible data vectors that can be transmitted. Correlation of the received signal to the reference vector corresponding to the transmitted data vector produces a large peak, and correlation of the received signal to the other possible reference vectors produces small peaks. Accordingly, the transmitted data vector can be easily determined in the receiver. Unfortunately, the data rate R typically associated with the use of matched filters is still too low for many applications.
When high data rates, such as Rxe2x89xa71, are required, equalizers are often used in a receiver in order to reduce ghosts. A classic example of a time domain equalizer is an FIR filter. An",553,11," FIR filter convolves its response h(t), shown"

(CN) – Abortion providers backed by the American Civil Liberties Union filed an anticipated lawsuit Friday morning challenging the constitutionality of Alabama’s near-total ban on the procedure, kicking off a legal battle that supporters of the ban hope will land in the nation’s highest court.

It’s been nine days since Alabama’s Republican Governor Kay Ivey signed the law banning abortion even in instances of rape and incest, saying “at least for the short term, this bill may … be unenforceable.”

The law was designed to rise to the U.S. Supreme Court, a test case for the bench remade under the Trump administration to reconsider the 1973 landmark decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion up until 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The 23-page complaint filed in Montgomery federal court by ACLU attorneys representing Alabama abortion providers kicked off that legal fight. It asks the court to declare that the law violates the 14th Amendment’s privacy and liberty rights and to issue an injunction preventing enforcement the law.

“H.B. 314 is the culmination of a near-decade long campaign by the Alabama legislature to eliminate legal abortion in Alabama,” the lawsuit states. “Since 2011, the Alabama legislature has enacted a multitude of laws aimed at restricting and ultimately outlawing abortion in the state.”

The complaint was filed on behalf of Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB-GYN who performs abortions in Huntsville, as well as Planned Parenthood Southeast and three clinics that perform abortions in the state – Alabama Women’s Center, Reproductive Health Services and West Alabama Women’s Center.

THE EAST IS RED #22 – Mystics in Bali (1981)

by Lisa Morton

Back in 1998, there was a book that came out called ""Mondo Macabro"" by Pete Tombs that rocked my cinematic world. The book’s subtitle – ""Weird and Wonderful Cinema Around the World"" – gives you just the tiniest hint of the wonders that are to be found in this amazing tome. Where most other books on cult or exploitation movies were covering the same old tired ground (really, how many essays praising Herschell Gordon Lewis as an auteur do we need?) and revisiting movies we’d not only heard of but actually seen, Mondo Macabro was presenting us with stuff like Indian horror movies by the Ramsay Brothers and a crazy Japanese flick called Exorsister and something deliriously titled Satanico Pandemonium. They had an inspiring section on Tsui Hark, and, back in the days when the internet was little more than a bunch of ugly graphics that still took forever to load on your dial-up connection, they were an amazing resource.
But one movie stood out even among the wonders described in Mondo Macabro. One movie sounded so marvelously strange and received such high praise that I instantly went running to every video store and distributor in town searching for it.
Nobody had ""Mystics in Bali"".

I hated Pete Tombs. This guy made this 1981 Indonesian cheapie sound like the most kickass thing EVER, and now it was turning out to be more like the mythological Holy Grail (I’m not kidding, either – even its eventual DVD box art referred to it as “The Holy Grail of Asian Cult Cinema”). It was impossible to find. Descriptions of it – the plot was supposed to center on an Indonesian creature called the leyak, which was a disembodied head flying around trailing its own innards – formed strange and glorious pictures in my mind.
Finally, five years after the publication of Mondo Macabro, a wonderful thing happened: Mondo Macabro became a DVD company, and Mystics in Bali was one of their first releases.
Then it went out of print almost immediately.
I’d missed the damned thing again. Occasional copies that turned up online were astronomical in price. I decided this was a movie I was destined to never see.

Then, in 2007, I heard that Mondo Macabro was about to re-release it in a remastered version. This time I didn’t wait: I pre-ordered that bastard. It was a magical day when it finally arrived.
So, was it worth the wait? Did it live up to its street rep as (in the words of one website review) “one of the most psychedelic experiences you'll ever have in front of a television set”?

Prostate cancer often has not symptoms in the early stages, and those that do appear early — namely problems with urination — can mimic those caused by benign conditions associated with aging. What should you be on the look out for?

Problems with urination are among the common symptoms of prostate cancer.

Let’s face it: Many of us put off seeing a doctor until things get worrisome. But for your own good and for the sake of the people you love, it’s important to take charge of your health. And knowing about prostate problems should be high on your priority list.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men (excluding skin cancer), and the second leading cause of cancer death. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 161,000 American men were diagnosed in 2017; it was the cause of nearly 27,000 deaths that year. (1)

What Are Early Signs of Prostate Cancer?

Here are the main symptoms of prostate cancer:

Frequent urination

Other urinary difficulties

Painful ejaculation

Blood in the urine or semen

Pain or stiffness in the hips, lower back or upper thighs

But a man may not experience any of these symptoms and still have prostate cancer.

After Diagnosis

For many men, the first sign of prostate problems involves urination changes.

“Some men may begin to notice increased frequency, slowing of their stream, and getting up at night to empty their bladder,” says Dr. Chodak.

Urinary troubles can often signal a noncancerous gland enlargement, which is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition that is common in men over 40. “Virtually every guy over 70 has some prostatic enlargement,” says Edward Geehr, MD, the chief medical officer of ILinkMD Corporation.

Still, any urination changes — including pain, weak flow, difficulty starting or stopping, frequent nighttime urination or blood in the urine or semen — should be evaluated by a doctor.

People With These Characteristics Should Pay More Attention to Symptoms

Some populations should take potential symptoms more seriously, because they’re at higher risk for the disease. These include:

1. Advanced age The older a man is, the greater his chances of developing prostate cancer. In fact, if a man lives long enough, the odds are very good that he will develop the disease. Cancer can be diagnosed, however, at much younger ages — even",552,11, at age 28. And men in their 20s and

A coronary involvement in type A aortic dissection is a serious phenomenon in clinic, which presents in 10-15% patients with aortic dissection^\[[@r2]\]^. Clinical research has shown that the mortality rate of a type A aortic dissection involving the coronary artery is high (up to 20% \~ 33.3%) after surgery^\[[@r3],[@r4]\]^.

The number of patients with CHF is expected to grow even more significantly as an increasing number of the “Baby Boomers” reach 50 years of age.
CHF is a condition that occurs when the heart becomes damaged and reduces blood flow to the organs of the body. If blood flow decreases sufficiently, kidney function becomes impaired and results in fluid retention, abnormal hormone secretions and increased constriction of blood vessels. These results increase the workload of the heart and further decrease the heart's pumping ability and, in turn, causes further reductions in blood flow to the kidney.

ESTATE OF SZACZYWKA: MAKAREWICZ and others, Appellants,
vs.
McEVOY and another, Respondents.
Supreme Court of Wisconsin.
May 4, 1955.
June 1, 1955.
*239 The cause was submitted for the appellants on the brief of Julius Grotsky and Vaudreuil & Vaudreuil, all of Kenosha, and for the respondents on the brief of John P. McEvoy of Kenosha.
STEINLE, J.
The sole question involved on this appeal is: When a decedent is survived only by a first cousin and by second cousins who are children of a first cousin who predeceased the decedent, does the first cousin inherit all of the decedent's estate to the exclusion of the second cousins' right to inherit the share their parent would have taken had he survived?
Sec. 237.01, Stats., provides in part:
""When any person shall die seized of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments or any right thereto or entitled to any interest therein, in fee simple, not having lawfully devised the same, they shall descend,... in the manner following:
""(1) In equal shares to his children and to the lawful issue of any deceased child by right of representation; and if there be no child of the intestate living at his death his estate shall descend to all his other lineal descendants; and if all the said descendants are in the same degree of kindred to the intestate they shall share the estate equally, otherwise they shall take according to the right of representation....
""(3) If the intestate leave no lawful issue nor widow nor widower nor father nor mother the estate shall descend in equal shares to the intestate's brothers and sisters and to the lineal descendents of any deceased brother or sister by right of representation.
""(4) If the intestate leave no lawful issue, widow, widower, father, mother, brother, nor sister the estate shall descend to the intestate's next of kin in equal degree, except that when *240 there are two or more collateral kindred in equal degree, but claiming through different ancestors, those who claim through the nearest ancestor shall be preferred to those claiming through an ancestor more remote; provided, however,...""
Sec. 237.07, Stats., provides that:
""Inheritance, or succession by right of representation, takes place when the descendants of any deceased heir take the same share or right in the estate of another person that their parent would have taken if living; posthumous children are considered as living at the death of their parents.""
The provisions of sec. 237.01 (4), Stats., apply to the situation in the case at bar.
Under the clear and express language of sec. 237.01 (4), Stats., the estate descends to the intestate's next of kin in equal degree. The item of ""succession by right of representation"" as defined in sec. 237.07 and as applicable in sec. 237.01 (1) and (3) is absent in sec. 237.01 (4). By virtue of such omission it is clear that the legislature intended that only the deceased's next of kin in equal degree are to share in the estate. As was held in Estate of Reil (1949), 70 Idaho, 64, 211 Pac. (2d) 407, 19 A. L. R. (2d) 186, a statute defining the term ""by right of representation"" has no application to a statute which does not provide for descent by right of representation, but restricts descent to ""next of kin in equal degree.""
Sec. 237.03, Stats., provides:
""DEGREES OF KINDRED, HOW COMPUTED. The degrees of kindred shall be computed according to the rules of the civil law; and kindred of the half blood shall inherit equally with those of the whole blood in the same degree unless the inheritance came to the intestate by descent, devise, or gift of some one of his ancestors; in which case all those who are not of the blood of such ancestors shall",888,11," be excluded from such inheritance.""

HJ

The HJ range - Holden Ute, Sandman Ute, Kingswood Ute and Kingswood
Sandman Ute (the Belmont name was dropped) - represented a major refinement
of the long-running HQ series. Front end styling was totally new, the
grille (with new Holden lion logo) more pronounced, bumpers more protruding.
Rear styling was carried over. Upgraded interiors featured full foam
seating, a new dash with revised two-outlet ventilation system and strip-style
speedo. All engines now had cable-type throttle control and 10cwt passenger
ride suspension was available as an option.

1976

HX

A major change to this series was the introduction of low-emission
versions of each Holden engine to meet the government's new Australian
Design Rule 27A. For the first time, drivers had the advantage of fingertip
control of wipers, washers, indicators and headlight beam via a stalk
mounted on the steering column. The Sandman'recreational' Ute and its
panel van variant, well promoted and with plenty of appeal for younger
Holden buyers, sold very well.

1977

HZ

The fourth revision of the body style that began with HQ, this range
was distinguished mainly by its 'egg crate' grille with headlights separate,
new badging and hubcaps. The HZ introduced an important advancement
in Holden suspension development, Radial Tuned Suspension (RTS), which
brought advancements in handling safety and better brakes. These combined
with other modifications - such as uprated springs and shock absorbers,
rear anti-rollbars and upgraded front bars - to give it a sportier feel.
The Sandman Ute was equipped with a 4.2 litre V8, power steering and
trip meter as standard.

CAD is an acronym for Computer-Aided Design, e.g. it relates to software solutions for designing an object. CAE is an acronym for Computer-Aided Engineering, e.g. it relates to software solutions for simulating the physical behavior of a future product. CAM is an acronym for Computer-Aided Manufacturing, e.g. it relates to software solutions for defining manufacturing processes and operations. In such systems, the graphical user interface (GUI) plays an important role as regards the efficiency of the technique. These techniques may be embedded within Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. PLM refers to a business strategy that helps companies to share product data, apply common processes, and leverage corporate knowledge for the development of products from conception to the end of their life, across the concept of extended enterprise.
The PLM solutions provided by Dassault Systemes (under the trademarks CATIA, ENOVIA and DELMIA) provide an Engineering Hub, which organizes product engineering knowledge, a Manufacturing Hub, which manages manufacturing engineering knowledge, and an Enterprise Hub which enables enterprise integrations and connections into both the Engineering and Manufacturing Hubs. All together the system delivers an open object model linking products, processes, resources to enable dynamic, knowledge-based product creation and decision support that drives optimized product definition, manufacturing preparation, production and service.
Such systems allow defining surfaces representing modeled objects or parts of modeled objects in an interactive way for designers. A famous method frequently used in CAD systems is the boundary representation (B-Rep) model using parametric surfaces, including e.g. planes, quadrics such as cylinders, spheres, cones or even torus, procedural surfaces such as fillets, sweeps, or revolve surfaces, and/or non-uniform rational B-Spline surfaces (NURBS). Representing complex object with this technology may be performed via the widely known concept of trimmed surfaces. Trimmed surfaces allow designing any kind of surface and solid models. A trimmed surface is a parametric surface delimited by boundaries. A trimmed surface may typically be associated to a portion of the 2D domain of a respective parametric surface. For example, referring to FIG. 1, four surfaces 31-34 are trimmed resulting in four new delimited (or “trimmed”) respective surfaces 36-39.
In other words, some known CAD systems allow designers to interactively define a B-Rep of a modeled object, the boundary representation comprising geometrical data including parametric surfaces and topological data including a set of faces each defined as a portion of the 2D domain of a respective parametric surface.
Once (or while being) defined by designers, such surfaces often need to be rendered, e.g. in order to be displayed. Systems offering rendering functionality may indeed for example display surfaces e.g. during the modeling or for the purpose of review/modification by designers. Today, a computer's Graphic Processor Unit (GPU) can display thousands of triangles really efficiently. However, a GPU cannot display a surface provided as a B-Rep directly. Such surfaces must be",660,11, transformed into a set of primitives that can be handled

How can a pendulum have amplitude greater than $\pi$?

How can a pendulum have amplitude angle greater than $\pi$? I've been reading about phase plots, which are graphs of the $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ on the $y$ axis and $\theta$ on the $x$ axis, shown below.

I can understand that the curves are not perfect ovals because we cannot use the small angle approximation. I can also see that there is one curve in the right side's drawing which looks like a sine curve shape, but intersects the $x$ axis at $\pi$ and $-\pi$.
But how are the other curves i.e. the curve intersecting $y$ axis at +2 created? What equation gives that and how would the pendulum's motion look? How would such an equation be derived?
I have a pendulum equation $$\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2g}{l}(1-cos\theta_A)}$$
($\theta_A$ is amplitude)
I derived that with conservation of energy laws, like for a simple pendulum but I did not do the small angle approximation. I tried to put $\theta_A=\pi+1$ and I got a simple oval, not the pair of curves that is symmetric about the $x$ axis. I do not understand the math and notation being used in this question: What is the period of a physical pendulum without using small-angle approximation?
I'm confused.

A:

How are the other curves i.e. the curve intersecting y axis at +2 created?

The trick behind understanding that phase portrait is realizing that the 'amplitude' is not the fundamental quantity which acts as the difference between those lines.
The amplitude of a pendulum is usually considered to be the angle or displacement at which the velocity is zero, according to conventional intuition. But we see that the line you pointed out, the one with a maximum angular velocity of $2$, never reaches $\frac{d\theta}{dt}=0$, so a 'pendulum'described by that line won't have an amplitude according to our usual definition.",485,11,"

Multivariate normal conditioned on sum of squares

Suppose that $X_i$ are i.i.d. N(0,1) random variables, and set $S =
 \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2$. Then $S \sim \chi^2_{(n)}$, the $\chi^2$
  distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom. Compute the induced
  probability measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$: $$\mu^s_n(A) := P((X_1, \dots,
 X_n) \in A | S = s),$$ where $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is
  Borel-measurable.

First, a proposed solution. Let $X = (X_1,..., X_n)$. Then $S = \|X\|^2$. Moreover, for any rotation matrix $O$, $OX$ has the same distribution as $X$. Thus, for any rotation matrix $O$, 
$$\mu^s(OA) = P(X \in OA | S = s) = P(O^{-1}X \in A | S = s) = \mu^s(A),$$
so $\mu$ is rotation invariant. Moreover, given that $S = s$, $X$ must lie on the sphere of radius $\sqrt{s}$, and $\mu^s(\mathbb{S}_{\sqrt{s}}^{n-1}) = 1$, where $\mathbb{S}_{\sqrt{s}}^{n-1}$ denotes the $n-1$-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of radius $\sqrt{s}$. Thus $\mu$ is a rotation-invariant probability measure which takes full mass on the $n-1$-sphere; by uniqueness of such measures, $\mu$ must be the uniform distribution on the $n-1$-sphere.
The problem I have is computing this explicitly. This measure is singular with respect to $\mathbb{R}^n$-Lebesgue measure, though theorems on regular conditional probabilities tell me this is a well-defined measure for each $s$. 
Problem
Take $n = 2$, let $R^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2$, $\theta = \arctan(X_2/X_1)$. We have
$$\left|\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial R}{\partial X_1} & \frac{\partial R}{\partial X_2} \\ \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial X_1} & \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial X_2}\end{pmatrix}\right| = \left|\begin{pmatrix} \frac{X_1}{\sqrt{X_1^2+X_2^2}} & \frac{X_2^2}{\sqrt{X_1^2+X_2^2}} \\ \frac{-X_2}{X_1^2+X_2^2} & \frac{X_1}{X_1^2+X_2^2}\end{pmatrix}\right| = \frac{1}{R}.$$
Hence, using independence of $X_1$ and $X_2$ and the density for a standard normal,
$$f(R,\theta) = f_{X_1,X_2}(X_1, X_2)\left|\frac{\partial (R,\theta)}{\partial (X_1,X_2)}\right|^{-1} = \frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-R^2}R.$$
From this we see further that $R$ and $\theta$ are actually independent, with $\theta$ being uniform on $(0,2\pi)$ (I know this",890,11," is not the case in higher dimensions). Thus, the"

A few nights ago, I went to bed with a Lyme fever and a sense of foreboding in my gut. I prayed that sleep would cure it, and hoped that I’d wake with renewed energy.

But, it was not to be. Instead, I felt worse — head pounding, body aching, panic rising.

It’s a weekday. I’m on my own. Why, O Lord? I can’t do this today.

Out of bed and shower before the sun is up. Feed the starving crowd. Change the baby. Break up the fighting, dry the toddler’s tears (and my own), rush out the door, and drop the big kids at school.

I held it together as long as I could. Then, in the parking lot, nursing the baby, listening to the 3-year-old beg for more snacks — I had my meltdown.

I love Facebook for many reasons, one of which is that it gives me the ability to communicate throughout the day with my people far and wide, without little ears hearing. And so I took my meltdown to Facebook messenger, and sobbed virtually (while keeping the real tears to a minimum) to a dear friend who lives 10 hours away.

I’m tired, I told her. I’m grieving. I’m struggling. I’m hurting.

Now let me tell you what she said, and what she didn’t, and why it was amazing.

White County is a county located in the U.S. state of Indiana.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 24,643.  The county seat is Monticello.

History 
White County was formed in 1834. It was named for Isaac White of Equality, Illinois who was killed at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. White was a Colonel in the Illinois militia, who volunteered to serve as a Private in the Indiana militia in the march against Prophetstown. He was placed under the command of Kentucky Maj. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss. The two exchanged swords in a demonstration of mutual respect at Fort Vincennes. In the Battle of Tippecanoe they died together and were buried in a common grave at Battle Ground.

Geography

Morris-Webb Motor Co., 180 So. 431 (Ct. App. La. 1938). See Patterson v. Surpless, supra (107 N.J.L., at p. 306); Jenkins v. Spitler, supra (199 S.E., at p. 371); Wheat v. Alderson, 234 Mo. App. 346, 130 S.W.2d 650, 652 (Ct. App. 1939).
The approach on the basis that the accident could not have happened if Auto Mart had not illegally loaned its license plates to Moore indicates no more than that the loan was a condition of the accident, not that it was its proximate cause. Moore's negligence was an exculpating superseding cause, Restatement of Torts, § 440; Worsham Buick Co. v. Isaacs, supra (51 S.W.2d at page 280). Nor was any hazard germane to the producing cause of *459 plaintiffs' injuries within the intended preventive scope of the statutes violated. See Prosser, op. cit., supra (page 269).
Plaintiffs' citation of Trautman v. Higbie, 10 N.J. 239 (Sup. Ct. 1952), does not help them. The decision merely applies a well-defined expansion of the doctrine of agency in a special field. Restatement of Torts, § 428; Venuto v. Robinson, 118 F.2d 679 (3rd Cir. 1941). The New York cases cited are irrelevant in regard to agency as the statute of that state imposes liability upon an owner for the negligent use of a car with his permission regardless of agency. Switzer v. Aldrich, 307 N.Y. 56, 120 N.E.2d 159 (1954). The effect of Peters v. Casualty Co. of America, 101 Wash. 208, 172 P. 220 (Sup. Ct. 1918), which supports plaintiffs' position, was erased by later legislation.
In our view plaintiffs' only substantial comfort derives from the Pennsylvania decision of Morgan v. Heinkel, 329 Pa. 360, 197 A. 920, 921 (Sup. Ct. 1938). There, in a factual setting somewhat resembling the present one, the court sustained the submission to a jury of the question of a dealer's liability for his purchaser's negligence while still using his plates, on the slender thread of the possibility that the purchaser was testing the car and was in that sense an employee of the seller. With all deference, our reading of the opinion fails to disclose any factual warrant for the holding. Moreover, there is no suggestion here that the car was being tested when Moore had his accident. In any event, both the result and the flavor of the Morgan case are in marked discordance with the decision of our own former Supreme Court in Hayes v. Brogan Cadillac-LaSalle Co., supra. It has for us no persuasiveness on the merits of the problem under analysis.

390,0,25455,3075," Rule 60.02 motion
challenging a trial court’s final judgment:

              Tennessee law is clear that the disposition of motions under Rule
       60.02 is best left to the discretion of the trial judge. Underwood v. Zurich
       Ins. Co., 854 S.W.2d 94, 97 (Tenn. 1993); Banks v. Dement Constr. Co.,

       Methodist Church, 958 S.W.2d 792, 795 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997). The
       standard of review on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion
       in granting or denying relief. This deferential standard “reflects an
       awareness that the decision being reviewed involved a choice among
                                             -4-

      will be reversed on appeal.” Lee Med[.], Inc. v. Beecher, 312 S.W.3d 515,
      524 (Tenn. 2010).

             A trial court abuses its discretion when it causes an injustice by
      applying an incorrect legal standard, reaching an illogical decision, or by
      resolving the case “on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id.

      the light most favorable to the decision.” Overstreet v. Shoney’s, Inc., 4

391,0,23456,0,"1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to a liquid crystal display, and more particularly to an array substrate for a liquid crystal display and a fabricating method thereof.
2. Discussion of the Related Art
Generally, a liquid crystal display (LCD) controls a light transmittance using an electric field to display a picture. To this end, the LCD includes a liquid crystal panel having liquid crystal cells arranged in a matrix form, and a driving circuit for driving the liquid crystal panel. The liquid crystal panel is provided with pixel electrodes and a common electrode for applying electric fields to the respective liquid crystal cells. Typically, for each liquid crystal cell, the pixel electrode is provided on a lower substrate, whereas the common electrode is formed on the entire surface of an upper substrate. Each of the pixel electrodes is connected to a thin film transistor (TFT), which is used as a switching device. The pixel electrode, along with the common electrode, drives the liquid crystal cell in accordance with a data signal applied to the TFT.
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, an array substrate 1 of an LCD includes a TFT arranged at an intersection between a data line 13 and a gate line 11, a pixel electrode 23 connected to a drain electrode 7 of the TFT, a data pad portion DP connected to the data line 13, and a gate pad portion GP connected to the gate line 11.
The TFT includes a gate electrode 3 connected to the gate line 11, a source electrode 5 connected to the data line 13, and a drain electrode 7 connected, via a drain contact hole 19b, to the pixel electrode 23. Further, the TFT includes semiconductor layers 15 and 17, which define a channel between the source electrode 5 and the drain electrode 7 when a gate voltage is applied to the gate electrode 3. Such a TFT responds to a gate signal from the gate line 11 to selectively apply a data signal from the data line 13 to the pixel electrode 23.
The pixel electrode 23 is positioned at a cell area divided by the data line 13 and the gate line 11, and is made from a transparent conductive material having a high light transmittance. The pixel electrode 23 is electrically connected, via the drain contact hole 19b, to the drain electrode 7. The pixel electrode 23 generates a potential difference relative to a common transparent electrode (not shown) provided at an upper substrate (not shown) by a data signal applied via the TFT. By this potential difference, the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal positioned between the array substrate 1 and the upper substrate are rotated due to its dielectric anisotropy. Due to this rotation, the liquid crystal allows selective transmission of light emitted from a light source through the pixel electrode 23 and the upper substrate.
The gate pad portion GP transmits a scanning signal, i.e., a gate pulse, which is generated from a gate driving integrated circuit (IC) (not shown), to the gate line 11. A gate pad terminal electrode 28 of",617,11, the gate pad portion GP electrically contacts a gate pad

Jackson County is the northeasternmost county in the U.S. state of Alabama. As of the 2010 census, the population was 53,227. The county seat is Scottsboro. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, general in the United States Army and afterward President of the United States of America. Jackson County is a prohibition or dry county, but three cities within the county (Bridgeport, Scottsboro, and Stevenson) are ""wet"", allowing alcohol sales.

Jackson County comprises the Scottsboro, AL Micropolitan Statistical Area. This is included in the Chattanooga-Cleveland-Dalton, TN-GA-AL Combined Statistical Area. It is the site of Russell Cave National Monument, an archeological site with evidence of 8,000 years of human occupation in the Southeast.

History
Jackson County was established on December 13, 1819, after the federal government arranged a treaty to remove the Cherokee from the area and extinguish their land claims. The hilly and mountainous terrain of the Appalachians made the area unsuitable for the plantation-style agriculture of the lowlands and coastal area. It was settled largely by families from Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia.

This area was developed largely for subsistence farming, and few families held any slaves. For instance, in 1860, Bellefonte, Alabama, then the county seat and largest community in the county, had a population of 181, of whom eight were free blacks and the remainder were white. No slaves were recorded in that community.

The county is crossed by a number of rivers and waterways; the most important is the Tennessee River, which drains most of the county. The current county seat of Scottsboro developed along the river, and was also the site of a railroad station when railroads reached the area. Hydroelectric power was developed in the first quarter of the 20th century to generate energy for industry. By the mid-20th century, industry had replaced agriculture as the most important element of the economy.

Geography

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of, of which  is land and  (%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in Alabama by total area. Much of it is located in the Appalachians.

Of special interest is Russell Cave National Monument, which is located in Doran Cove, approximately 5 miles west of the town of Bridgeport.

Eduard Zuckmayer (3 August 1890 in Nackenheim, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany – 2 July 1972 in Ankara, Turkey) was a German pedagogue, composer, conductor and pianist. He was the older brother of the famous German writer Carl Zuckmayer (1896–1977).

Family and Youth 
He was born as the first son of the wealthy factory owner Carl Zuckmayer (1864–1947) who produced Tamper-evident caps for wine bottles in Nackenheim which is a wine-growing village on the Rhine front. The parents of his mother Amalie Zuckmayer (1869–1954), née Goldschmidt, were converted from Judaism to Protestantism whereas he was raised as a Catholic. From the age of six, he got piano lessons. His talent was recognised early. At the age of twelve, he started to compose. However, he started to study jurisprudence but soon quit. In 1909 he took private piano lessons from Robert Kahn (1865–1951) and James Kwast (1852–1927) in Berlin. He also attended the conductor's school of Fritz Steinbach (1855–1916) and became a piano pupil of Lazzaro Uzielli (1861–1943) at Conservatory in Cologne. In 1914 he got concert level as pianist and conductor.

Work

Germany 
In 1915 he was a conductor at City theatre in Mainz. He and his younger brother volunteered as soldiers in World War I. He was severely wounded and decorated twice with the Iron cross 2nd class and later with the Iron cross 1st class. Between 1919 and 1925 he lived in Frankfurt where he performed Paul Hindemith's Sonata in D for violin and piano op. 11, No. 2. He worked as a music teacher, conductor, and pianist. In 1923 he became co-founder of Gesellschaft für Neue Musik (= Society of New Music) in Mainz and Wiesbaden. From 1923 to 1925 he also led a piano class at Mainz conservatory. At that time he was regarded as a brilliant concert pianist with a high chance for a marvellous career. But as an enthusiast of German Jugendmusikbewegung (= Youth Music Movement) he wanted to participate in the education of a new generation as a countermovement to the tattered political situation at Weimar Republic. He wanted music to be a part of many people's life. In contrary to middle-class culture Jugendmusikbewegung enhanced the status of amateur music.

Therefore, he followed a call of pedagogue Martin Luserke (1880–1968) to work as a music teacher at Schule am Meer, a progressive boarding school on Juist Island at North Sea. There he founded the school's choir and its orchestra which included all pupils. In this progressive school sports, music and community theatre were elementary. Musical education was regarded as bridging between the fine arts and life. With his pupils Zuckmayer went on several tours through Germany and got very positive reviews in contemporary newspapers. For one of his compositions his brother Carl visited the school to write the lyrics. Other lyrics were created by Luserke. When Nazism was brought to power in January 1933 the school's work became much more difficult since it counted about one third Jewish pupils and teachers. Due to Antisemitism and ""Gleichschaltung"" (= Nazification) the school closed in spring 1934. Zuckmayer changed to Odenwald",763,11,"schule, another progressive boarding school in Hesse."
396,0,26435,0,"For much of the past two years, Israel stood sphinx-like on the sidelines of Syria’s civil war.

Did it want Bashar al-Assad’s regime toppled? Did it favour military intervention to help opposition forces? And what did it think of the increasing visibility of Islamist groups in Syria? It was difficult to guess.

In recent weeks, however, Israel has moved from relative inaction to a deepening involvement in Syrian affairs. It launched two air strikes on Syrian positions last month. At the same time, it fomented claims that Damascus had used chemical weapons, in what looked suspiciously like a bid to corner Washington into direct intervention.

Recently, based on renewed accusations of the use of the nerve agent sarin by Syria, the US said it would start giving military aid directly to the opposition.

With suspicions of Israeli meddling growing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was finally forced to deny as “nonsense” evidence that Israeli forces are operating secretly over the border.

Nonetheless, the aura of inscrutability has hardly lifted, stoked by a series of leaks from Israeli officials. Their statements have tacked wildly between threats to oust Assad one moment and denials that Israel has any interest in his departure the next.

Is Israel sending out contradictory signals to sow confusion, or is it simply confused itself?

The answer can be deduced in the unappealing outcomes before Israel whoever emerges triumphant. Israel stands to lose strategically if either Assad or the opposition wins decisively.

Better the devil you know

Assad, and his father Hafez before him, ensured that the so-called separation of forces line between Syria and Israel, after the latter occupied the Golan Heights in 1967, remained the quietest of all Israel’s borders.

A taste of what might happen should the Syrian regime fall was provided in 2011 when more than 1000 Palestinians massed in the no man’s land next to the Golan, while Assad’s attention was directed to repressing popular demonstrations elsewhere.

At least 100 Palestinians crossed into the Heights, with one even reaching Tel Aviv.

In recent days, after intensified fighting between the rebels and the Syrian army over Quneitra, a town next to the only crossing between Israel and Syria, United Nations peacekeepers from Austria started pulling out due to the dangers.

Briefly, the opposition forces captured Quneitra, offering a reminder that any void there would likely suck in Palestinian militants and jihadists keen to settle scores with Israel.

That point was underlined by one Israeli official, who told the London Times: “Better the devil we know than the demons we can only imagine if Syria falls into chaos, and the extremists from across the Arab world gain a foothold there.”

For that reason, the Israeli military is reported to considering two responses familiar from Lebanon: invading to establish a security zone on the other side of the demarcation line, or covertly training and arming Syrian proxies inside the same area.

Neither approach turned out well for Israel in Lebanon, but there are indications ― despite Netanyahu’s denial ― that Israel is already pursuing the second track.

According to the New York Times, Israel is working with Syrian villagers not allied to Assad or the opposition and offering “humanitarian aid” and “maintaining intense intelligence activity”.

In an interview with the Argentinian media last month, Assad accused",719,11," Israel of having gone further, “directly supporting"

402,0,27588,2050," financial hardship..."". Government's Memorandum, p. 19.
At oral argument, counsel for Scharrer asserted that Scharrer was on the verge of bankruptcy, a contention which the Government's attorney stated took him by surprise. Scharrer was allowed time to file an affidavit as to his financial condition and he has done so. The Government by letter dated June 24, 1982 points persuasively to the gaps in Mr. Scharrer's affidavit as to his *479 financial posture and his failure to account fully for all assets at his disposal and the disposition of funds previously available to him. Were this the decisive factor with respect to the motion, we might pursue the Government's suggestion that there be further inquiry into Mr. Scharrer's financial ability to stand trial in New York. We do not so regard this consideration and assume for these purposes that although trial in New York City would of course be more expensive for the defendants, it would not be beyond their financial capacity.

7. Location of counsel.

Location of counsel is not a decisive factor in this case. Posner's attorney is headquartered in Washington, D.C. but readily agrees that he practices nationally. Scharrer's counsel has newly entered this case, fully aware that it was scheduled for trial in New York in September.

8. Relative accessibility of place of trial.

Relative accessibility of place of trial is a neutral factor; both New York and Miami are well served by air and other public transport.

9. Docket condition of each district.

We believe that the most serious factor weighing against transfer is the state of the docket in Miami and the effect which the transfer might have in delaying the trial of this case presently set for September 13, 1982. The Government urges that ""a transfer moreover will compound the problem of judicial administration in the Southern District of Florida, where 4,000 indictments are anticipated in the near future."" Government's Memorandum, p. 19. The defendants' reply that the concerns with regard to the Miami docket are all prospective and somewhat conjectural. This Court's independent inquiry as to the state of the Miami docket confirms the accuracy of defendants' description. Moreover, if the consequence of a transfer of this case would be to occasion untoward delay in its being reached for trial, other procedures are available to enable the trial to go forward expeditiously.[2] However, the criminal docket in this Court is relatively current and although, as indicated above, the docket problem is not insurmountable, this factor tilts against transfer.

10. Any other special elements which might affect the transfer.

Finally, we",547,11," consider the tenth factor which Platt enumerates, i"
403,0,20587,4100," vitamin D3, and found no significant reduction specifically in C-reactive protein.

However, in different contexts from the previous study, another very relevant study[@bib0580] demonstrated that patients supplemented with vitamin D3 of 10 ng/mL for 3 months showed improvement in endothelial function, reduction of oxidative stress and improvement in insulin sensitivity. This finding may encourage the scientific community to improve respiratory microcirculation, as obstruction and vascular resistance have been a major concern for scientists during the COVID-19 pandemic.[@bib0585]

And to further encourage researchers in relation to the benefits of vitamin D, an epidemiological study by Melamed et al. (2008) found that low levels of vitamin D3 increase the risk of mortality. This study used NHANES III data, collected from 1988 to 1994, studying 13,331 adult individuals of both genders with an average follow-up of 8.8 years. The result was 1,806 deaths, 43% from cardiovascular disease, 26% from cancer, 6% from infectious diseases and 5% from external causes. It was found that people with serum vitamin 25-OH-vitamin-D3 levels between 40-49 ng/mL had a lower mortality rate.[@bib0590]

The indication of digestive overload found in the patient in this study using the functional neurometry[@bib0445] may be related to parasites, but it may also have been due to sedentary habits, which seems to explain his low vitamin B12 as well. This result seems to reinforce the hypotheses about the obstructions of the respiratory microcirculation.[@bib0585]

Kwok et al. (2012)[@bib0595] conducted a study using vitamin B12 in 50 vegetarian subjects who had serum B12 \< 150 pmol/L (\<202 pg/mL) and the results showed a significant serum increase in B12, a decrease in homocysteine and a significant improvement in dilation mediated by brachial flow from 6.3 ± 1.8% to 7.4 ± 1.7%. The conclusion of this study was that B12 supplementation improved the arterial function of vegetarians with subnormal B12 levels, thus proposing a new strategy for the prevention of atherosclerosis.

In this context of importance of vitamin B12, another study[@bib0600] recently published reinforces the importance of vitamin B12 in the treatment of COVID-19, the authors point out that the virus of the Coronaviridae family (COVID-19) has a single-stranded positive RNA genome. This genome encodes the nsp12 protein, which hosts the RNA polymerase-dependent RNA (RdRP) activity responsible for replicating the viral genome.

Thus, the authors[@bib0600] report that a nsp12 homology model was prepared using the SARS nsp12 (6NUR) framework and that it was used to screen silica to identify molecules among FDA-approved natural products or drugs that could potentially inhibit nsp12 activity. However, this experiment showed that vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) can bind to the active site as an inhibitor of the nsp12 protein.[@bib0600]

Regarding total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL and LDL, this study highlighted the results of TG and HDL of the patient who died after acquiring COVID-19. In addition to the TG being well above 611 mg/dL ([Table 2](#tbl0010){ref-type=""table""}) of the expected reference value \[\<150 mg/dL\], there are findings in the literature demonstrating ideal values expected from CT/HDL ratios ≤3.3, TG/HDL ≤2.5 and LDL/HDL ≤2.3,[@bib0605] called atherogenicity indexes, functioning as a safe predictor of high lipoprotein density with the risk of coronary disease. Data from the Framingham study show that each 1 mg/dL increase in HDL decreases the coronary disease mortality rate by 2% for men and 3% for women.[@bib0605], [@bib0610]

However, Tian and Fu (2010)[@bib0605] establish that the greater the result of the relationship between CT/HDL and TG/HDL, the less will be the protective effect of HDL, because it will indicate a greater quantity of small HDLs (HDL Pre 1) and lesser quantities of large HDLs (HDL2b) and add that when these relationships worsen, not only the HDL amount worsens, but the type of HDL as well.[@bib0605]

The HDL is responsible for much more than transporting cholesterol from arteries and peripheral tissues to the liver; it has antioxidant action, anti",1023,11,"-inflammatory action, pro-fibrinolytic"
404,0,23885,0,"See related research by Bøyesen *et al.*, <http://arthritis-research.com/content/11/4/R103>

The elegant study by Bøyesen and colleagues \[[@B1]\] in the previous issue of *Arthritis Research & Therapy*, in which they observed the changes in hand bone mineral density (BMD) using digital x-ray radiogrammetry (DXR) in 163 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is most welcome. DXR measures the cortical thickness, width, and porosity of the central parts of metacarpals 2 to 4. After 1, 2, and 5 years of observation, the decreases in hand BMD were -1.7%, -2.8%, and -5.6%, respectively. Elevated levels of both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) were independent predictors of hand bone loss at all time points, indicating that the largest amounts of bone loss were found in patients with severe inflammation and high levels of auto-antibodies; from earlier data, we know that these patients are prone to develop severe RA with radiological joint damage \[[@B2]\].

RA is a chronic progressive disorder characterised by synovitis, bone and cartilage degradation of the joints, and extra-articular symptoms. Based on the dramatic improvement in treatment options in RA, clinical remission is a realistic target of therapy \[[@B2]\]. In particular, the use of biologicals early in the course of RA is exciting and addresses two of the most important research questions in modern rheumatology: is it possible to predict which RA patients will have a favourable response to conventional (methotrexate, or MTX) therapy? And what are the characteristics of RA patients with an unfavourable prognosis, estimated by radiological joint damage, for which more aggressive therapy is indicated?

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop validated assessment tools for identifying patients who are at risk for a poor prognosis, estimated by early radiological joint damage. Juxta-articular bone loss and subchondral bone oedema due to the replacement of marrow fat by heavily vascularised inflammatory cells are the earliest signs of bone involvement in RA and may even precede the development of radiologically detectable erosions of the joint \[[@B3],[@B4]\].

In the Norwegian study, changes in hip and spine BMD were not mentioned, but in the BeST (Behandel Strategieën) study (also in patients with early RA), it was observed that the hand bone loss was roughly two to five times higher than the generalised bone loss at the spine and hips \[[@B5]\]. This difference presumably reflects the fact that BMD changes at the hands are more sensitive to cytokine stimulation in the adjacent inflamed joints. Güler-Yüksel and colleagues \[[@B5]\] observed that the changes in hand BMD mirror the progression of radiological joint damage according to the Sharp-van der Heijde score (SHS). This inverse relationship suggests that adjacent joint damage and cortical metacarpal bone loss presumably result from the same mechanisms: inflammation-driven upregulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, inter",710,11,"leukin-1 (IL-1), IL"

To NJCAA Glory

By Ted WaddellLOCH SHELDRAKE  November 26, 2004  Chris DePew, Sullivan County Community College Athletic Director and head coach of the schools mens basketball team, is a familiar face around town. But except for a couple of returning sophomores, his cadre of freshmen hoopsters are new kids on the block.
Last years team was strictly sophomore-based, said DePew, reflecting back on the squad that posted a 26-6 overall record during the 2003-2004 season.
We didnt have a lot of depth, and I had to rely on them playing a lot of minutes the sophomores had been to a regional championship [the previous season], had experience and understood the system, he added.
DePew said the 2004-2005 Generals have their own team identity. Of the 13 freshmen who are listed on the teams roster, 11 of them are suiting up for games as of press time.
Its a new experience, brand new kids learning a new system, he said. Were young, but were very talented once they start to jell and learn each others games, I think this is going to be a special group.
DePew said that if his band of freshmen sticks together for a couple of years while wrapping up their studies and learning his brand of hoops, theyre going to make a lot of people very happy.
So far, the Generals are pleasing their coaches and fans. After an 84-54 win over Bronx Community College on Saturday night, SCCC is a perfect 4-0 on the season.
Leading the team to victory over Bronx CC were sophomore guard Greg Johnson and freshman forward Antoine Williams. Johnson scored a team-high 21 points and Williams netted 17 on the evening.
The Generals coach said he fully expects this squad to qualify for the 2005 National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Region XV Championships, which will be held on Saturday and Sunday March 5 and 6 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.
Im sure were going to have some bumps along the road, DePew said.
As a case in point, DePew cited last Thursday nights 83-80 victory over the Passaic (NJ) Panthers as a demonstration of the composure and team unity of the Generals. After the opposition took a lead in the first frame and came charging back in the second half, the Generals didnt let a Panthers comeback rattle their resolve to win.
These guys understand that things happen and that other teams go on runs, he said. We just need to adapt and move on.
DePew said that with last years team, there would have been a lot of yelling and finger pointing. But the Generals of",708,11, 2004-05 are a lot different when it comes to

Inside an ArcGIS Server site

In this topic

An ArcGIS Server site consists of several components that can optionally be distributed across multiple machines to increase computing power. Each component in the site plays a specific role in the process of managing the resources that are allocated to a set of services.

ArcGIS Server—Does the work to satisfy requests issued to the GIS web services. ArcGIS Server can draw maps, run tools, serve imagery, synchronize databases, project geometry, search for data, and perform many other operations offered by ArcGIS.

This topic summarizes each of the components and provides links to additional information to help you effectively administer your ArcGIS Server site.

The web server

The web server hosts web applications and provides optional security and load balancing benefits to the ArcGIS Server site. ArcGIS Server is compatible with many popular web servers, including Internet Information Services (IIS), WebSphere, and WebLogic.

The ArcGIS Server component exposes your services through HTTP without requiring you to have a separate, dedicated web server such as IIS. However, if you want to harness some of the native security benefits of the web server (such as authentication options), or if you want to host web applications, you can choose to include a web server in your deployment.

ArcGIS Web Adaptor

ArcGIS Web Adaptor is fundamentally a web application that forwards requests from your web server to your ArcGIS Server. ArcGIS Web Adaptor keeps track of which machines have been added and removed from your site and forwards traffic to them appropriately. Using ArcGIS Web Adaptor allows you to set your own name for your site, instead of using the default site name arcgis. ArcGIS Web Adaptor also allows you to leverage the native capabilities of your web server for security, and can block outside connections to ArcGIS Server Manager and the ArcGIS Server Administrator Directory.

When a web service request is received, ArcGIS Web Adaptor forwards the request to one of the ArcGIS Server machines. If ArcGIS Web Adaptor determines a ArcGIS Server machine is unavailable, it stops forwarding requests to that server.

Other web gateway options

The Web Adaptor is not the only way to configure a web gateway, or entry point, to your site. Other web gateway technologies can include physical HTTP load balancer and network router devices, or third-party software designed for load balancing purposes. In the Amazon EC2 environment, the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) can act as a web gateway. If you already have existing technology in your organization that plays the role of a web gateway, it can be adapted to work with ArcGIS Server under most circumstances.

Although the web gateway and web server often work together, the presence of a web gateway in the deployment does not necessitate the presence of a web server. For example, if your web gateway is a physical router, it can send requests directly to the ArcGIS Server without needing a web server.

ArcGIS Server

Incoming web service requests for maps, address coordinates, geoprocessing jobs, and so on, are each assigned to an available ArcGIS Server machine within the site. That ArcGIS Server then does the work of drawing the map, finding the address coordinate, running the geoprocessing tool, and so on, and returns the result to the client. Essentially, ArcGIS Server machines are the work centers of your site.

You may find it necessary to configure your Arc",753,11,GIS Server site to use multiple ArcGIS Server

410,0,27211,0,"Just a couple weeks ago 1500 blockchain entrepreneurs, experts, investors, and enthusiasts gathered in Singapore at BlockShow Asia, Cointelegraph’s second Blockchain event of the year.

During the event 67 speakers from 20 different countries shared their insights and ideas, and attendees from a variety of backgrounds --from Blockchain to business to finance -- met to discuss topics ranging from practical application of Blockchain technology to new ICOs launching right at the event.

What is BlockShow?

BlockShow is an international event powered by Cointelegraph and centered around innovation in Blockchain technology. The event is more than just a conference -- it’s a meeting place, a chance to discover new projects, and an opportunity to showcase your ideas in front of an active and interested audience.

BlockShow brings together entrepreneurs, experts, investors, and enthusiasts searching for exciting new projects and potential partners, as well as exclusive industry announcements and insights.

BlockShow has held two events so far -- the first in Munich this past Spring, and the second just last month in Singapore.

What is BlockShow Asia?

BlockShow Asia is the second BlockShow event so far. It took place Nov. 29-30, 2017 in Singapore.

The event included ICOscar (a competition for new Blockchain startups sponsored by WAVES and Crypto Bazar), Hypethon (a chance for 12 select ICOs to jumpstart their funding, sponsored by CryptoFriends and esports.com), and a place for businesses to show their new products, acquire feedback on various new solutions, and share their thoughts and ideas, both on stage and in informal meetings.

Singapore is one of the biggest financial hubs in the world. Both on at the government and private levels the city-state has recently shown serious interest in the Blockchain industry.

One of the events attendees, Simon Dixon, CEO and co-founder of BnkToTheFuture.com, shared his thoughts about the event and the location choice, stating:

“Well you couldn’t have picked a better place in Asia! Singapore is awesome! There is a really great attendance here.

412,0,26409,0,"Scholars Differ on Legality of New NFL National Anthem Policy

After the NFL announced Wednesday that its players on the field must stand respectfully for the national anthem or face fines – or remain in locker rooms until the anthem is over — two questions linger: Can the NFL legally require its players to stand? Do the players have any viable legal recourse?

The answers depend on who you ask.

Dr. Alvin Tillery

“It is truly an open question whether the NFL’s rule is legal,” said Dr. Alvin Tillery, an associate",119,11, professor of political science and director of the Center for the
413,0,29494,1025,"sthan their bachelor counterparts. Children born to married parents are lesslikely to experience poverty, abuse, and behavioral and emotional problemsthan children born out of wedlock.

So Doherty is hustling to keep couples together—and sometimes even get themmarried. It’s consuming work that has Doherty delivering keynote speeches atconferences around the world and leading talks and groups here at home.Minnesota has a long history of support for couples and families, he says.But that doesn’t mean there’s always unanimous support for the kind ofmarriage-boosting initiatives Doherty would like to see funded. The state’s“many liberals and progressives identify a marriage-positive stance as aconservative value,” he says. (Lest you think he sounds like a right-wingpatsy: He’s pro–gay marriage. Communities are healthier, he says, whensame-sex couples are in committed, socially sanctioned relationships.)

IT’S DINNERTIME on a Thursday night and Danyelle and Davis Draheim areeating Subway sandwiches with other couples in the basement of CatholicCharities of St. Paul and Minneapolis. They’re here to participate in a talkled by Doherty on “Men and Women: How Are We Different?” The event is partof the Minnesota Family Formation Project, a Doherty-led effort for unwedparents interested in marriage—to keep fathers involved in their kids livesand reduce the strain on mothers who are often financially and emotionallystrapped.

Doherty relaxes as he talks, his scholarly locution replaced by the EastCoast accent of his working-class childhood. He grew up in a largeIrish-Catholic family in Philadelphia, where, he says, “marriage wasforever.” He met his wife, Leah, in 1970, and perhaps not unexpectedly, theunion has become a lab for Doherty’s ideas on how to get couples to connect:He often tells groups how he and his wife used to shoo their children awayfrom the table after dinner so they could talk for a few minutes—one onone—over a cup of coffee. Their rituals also include a nightly dip in thehot tub outside their Roseville home.

As the crowd polishes off the sandwiches, Doherty talks about expectationsin marriages. “We expect our spouse to act like our very best same-sexfriend,” he says. Heads nod with recognition. “It’s not going to happen,” headds. The group laughs.

The Draheims are here because they saw a flyer in a packet of new-babyliterature shortly after their first son was born. If they signed up toparticipate in a new program for unmarried couples, the flyer indicated,they could avail themselves of the services offered by a relationship coach,meet with a married mentor couple, participate in the “Couples Connection”classes Doherty leads, and get a yearly stipend. “It was 70 bucks,” saysDavis. “What did we have to lose?” Within a year of receiving the flyer,they were married.

It isn’t the first time Doherty has used financial incentives to encouragepeople to think about getting married or about nurturing their marriage. In2001, Doherty worked with state senator Steve Dille, of Dassel, to securewhat is now a $70 discount on marriage licenses for couples who complete 12hours’ worth of premarital classes. (Nearly 40 percent of newlyweds takeadvantage of the marriage-license discount, which couples can obtain if theyprovide proof that they’ve completed a pre-marriage education program.) In2004, Doherty and Dille worked together again to secure a $5marriage-license surcharge to augment $1 million in federal TemporaryAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds for the Family Formation Project.

Is there a return on the investment in marriage that Doherty—andtaxpayers—have made? Nationally, the divorce rate for college-educated womenhas dropped by one third in the last decade, and Doherty says young peoplehave a different view of divorce than their parents: 45 percent of 18 to 29year olds say divorce should be avoided except in extreme cases. Doherty’sown research on premarital education has found that premarital couplesprograms strengthens unions: A majority of",930,11, the couples he surveyed saidpre-wedding conversations

In 1980, Johnson Wax Associates consolidated three of its holdings, Eureka Tent & Awning Company (now just Eureka! Tent, Inc.); Camp Trails Company of Phoenix, Arizona, a backpack and sleeping bag manufacturer; and Silva of LaPorte, Indiana, a compass and cross-country ski manufacturer, into Johnson Camping, Inc., which was then headquartered in Eureka's head office in Binghamton. Johnson Wax Associates named Eureka's DeMartine president of the new conglomerate and through Johnson Camping, Eureka expanded from 300 to 500 employees and from three to five plants in New York, Arizona, Indiana, and Canada.

During the 1980s, Eureka! expanded its camping tent business, as camping as an outdoor social activity was in full stride in North America and Eureka! StormShield tents continued to be carried to the highest mountains on the globe, including during these American and Canadian-led expeditions:  Dhaulagiri I (1980), Yalungkang (known as Kangchenjunga now) (1981), Canadian Everest (1982), American Women's Himalyan Expedition to Ama Dablam (1982), Makalu (1983), and American Men & Women on Everest (1983). In 1987, Johnson Worldwide Associates took its holdings public and put around two million shares on the over-the-counter market.

During the 1990s, Eureka! expanded its military tent business into multimillion-dollar figures. In 1993, Johnson Worldwide Associates moved marketing, sales, research and development, and customer service functions for all of its divisions to Racine, Wisconsin as part of a broader centralization plan.

Eureka!'s current product line includes camping tents, expeditionary tents, military tents, as well as camping equipment to include furniture, cooking equipment, sleeping bags, pads, and more.

Organizations and individuals known to have used Eureka! tents over the years include Sir Edmund Hillary on a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal; the nineteen-man team on the first all-American expedition to Mt. Everest; the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I; Eric Simonson on two research expeditions to Mt. Everest;  then-President George H. W. Bush, whom Bass Pro Employees in Springfield, Missouri spotted purchasing a Eureka! tent in 1991;  the Girl Scouts of the USA; the Boy Scouts of America; the Arctic Institute of North America; the United States Department of the Interior; the Geological Survey; the Peace Corps; Lee African Safaris; and the U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze.

423,0,21741,0,"Jerusalem (CNN) Energized by American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the country's right-wing government has accelerated plans that imperil a two-state solution, solidifying Israel's power and control over Jerusalem.

In an all-night session, the Knesset, Israel's parliament, enacted a law early Tuesday making it much more difficult to negotiate Jerusalem as part of a peace process. The holy city is the most sensitive -- and perhaps most important -- issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with parts of the city claimed by both sides as their capital.

Only days earlier, a guiding body for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party voted unanimously to apply Israeli law to West Bank settlements. Although that vote was non-binding, such a move would be seen as Israeli annexation of the territory.

The law was passed as an amendment to Israel's Basic Law -- the closest thing Israel has to a constitution -- which gives it more political weight. The amendment stipulates that any attempt to transfer sovereign control of Jerusalem to a foreign entity needs to be approved by a supermajority of 80 Knesset members out of 120.

Previously, the requirement was a majority of 61 members.

And, in a move that is surely to be met with Palestinian outrage, the amendment also authorizes the Knesset to change the municipal borders of Jerusalem with a simple majority, provided any neighborhoods removed from the city remain under Israeli sovereignty. That allows Israel to remove Palestinian neighborhoods from the city per the Greater Jerusalem Plan being advanced by members of Netanyahu's governing coalition.

""The goal is one that is shared by the overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis,"" Deputy Minister Michael Oren told CNN,"" that Jerusalem will remain our capital and a Jewish majority city.""

In response to the new",367,11," law, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said"

The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center separately maintains the Terrorist Screening Database, which is commonly referred to as the Terrorist Watchlist. The FBI told Feinstein’s office that there are about 1 million records in the TSDB, and about 0.5 percent of those — or fewer than 5,000 records — are of U.S. persons. The watch list includes about 81,000 names on the so-called no-fly list, including fewer than 1,000 names of U",154,11,".S. persons.

426,0,21453,0,"The present invention relates generally to lithography and more particularly relates to a system and method for measuring films associated with lithography processes or other type semiconductor fabrication processes.
In the semiconductor industry there is a continuing trend toward higher device densities. To achieve these high densities there has been, and continues to be, efforts toward scaling down the device dimensions on semiconductor wafers. In order to accomplish such a high device packing density, smaller features sizes are required. This may include the width and spacing of interconnecting lines and the surface geometry such as the comers and edges of various features.
The requirement of small features with close spacing between adjacent features requires high resolution photolithographic processes. In general, lithography refers to processes for pattern transfer between various media. It is a technique used for integrated circuit fabrication in which, for example, a silicon wafer is coated uniformly with a radiation-sensitive film (e.g., a photoresist), and an exposing source (such as ultraviolet light, x-rays, or an electron beam) illuminates selected areas of the film surface through an intervening master template (e.g., a mask or reticle) to generate a particular pattern. The exposed pattern on the photoresist film is then developed with a solvent called a developer which makes the exposed pattern either soluble or insoluble depending on the type of photoresist (i e., positive or negative resist). The soluble portions of the resist are then removed, thus leaving a photoresist mask corresponding to the desired pattern on the silicon wafer for further processing.
As process designers continue to shrink the size of the features which make up various semiconductor components, various process parameters must be tightly controlled. For example, in order to provide small, repeatable feature sizes, the thickness of various films such as photoresist layers and anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) must be small and uniform about the surface of the wafer. Consequently, process designers regularly measure the thickness of such films.
Film thicknesses typically are determined using characterization equations provided by the tool manufacturers which use various film material constants such as absorption coefficients and optical constants such as the index of refraction. Using such equations, process developers can implement various tests and take various parametric measurements, insert the measured data into the equations, and calculate an approximate film thickness. Although such thickness determination techniques are modestly accurate, the characterization equations require that the various film material constants which characterize the film be known. For newly developed materials such as next generation photoresists and ARC materials, such advanced characterization data is not easily available, thus making the determination of such film thicknesses difficult.
The present invention relates to a system and method of measuring accurately a film thickness without the use of film material characterization data.
According to one aspect of the present invention, the system and method of measuring a film thickness includes identifying a location of a defect, for example, a crystalline defect, in an underlying material such as a semiconductor substrate. Using the defect location information, the depth or height of the defect is measured using, for example, a topography evaluation tool. After the film to be measured is formed over the underlying material, the defect, which is reproduced in the overlying film, is again measured to identify the depth or height associated there",674,11,with.

428,0,24972,0,"Neutron radiography is a non-destructive testing process used for determining certain material characteristics. In its simplest terms, neutron radiography is accomplished by irradiating an object with neutrons and measuring the resulting flux of neutrons which pass through the object per unit area. Material variations and characteristics of the tested object may thereby be detected by observing variations in neutron flux through the object. Neutron radiography is most often accomplished using thermal neutrons, or those neutrons having an average kinetic energy of about twenty-five one thousandths electron volts (0.025 eV). Some applications of neutron radiography require the use of cold neutrons, or neutrons having a kinetic energy less than five one thousandths electron volts (0.005 eV). Other applications may require the use of epithermal neutrons, or neutrons having kinetic energies up to a few electron volts. Neutrons with any of these energy levels are usually produced by thermalizing, or ""moderating"", high energy neutrons (up to several MeV), known as fast neutrons, which are emitted by a neutron source. This moderation is accomplished by directing the fast neutrons through a moderating material. The thermalization process results in an energy spectrum of neutrons essentially in thermal equilibrium with the moderating material.
Several different types of fast neutron sources for radiography are used. For example, nuclear reactors are one source of neutrons which provide highly intense beams of neutrons for irradiating an object to be tested. For many important applications of neutron radiography, however, it is desirable to have a neutron source other than a nuclear reactor.
An alternative source of neutrons known in the prior art is a Van de Graff accelerator. It produces neutrons for irradiation by accelerating deuterons against a beryllium target to produce fast neutrons. The beryllium target is disposed in a chamber of moderator material appropriate for moderating, or thermalizing, the fast neutrons down to the desired neutron energy level for radiography. An example of such a device is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,515 which issued to Whittemore.
Yet other sources of neutrons for radiography are radioisotopes. One such radioisotope is californium-252, which emits, by radioactive decay, approximately 10.sup.6 neutrons per second per microgram of californium. The seemingly large neutron flux produced by californium-252 and other radioisotopes, however, is still much less intense than the neutron flux produced by a nuclear reactor. It is, therefore, important to make optimum use of all available neutrons when using a radioisotope neutron source in order to obtain a good image with a minimum of exposure time. A neutron radiography device using a radioisotope as the neutron source may incorporate one or several design features to fulfill the requirement of optimum use of available neutrons. For example, as is well known in the art, neutron flux will vary throughout the radiography device. The radiography apparatus could be designed to establish a maximum thermal neutron flux at the imaging plane. One way of achieving this result is to dispose the radioisotope sources in a neutron moderator such that the imaging plane is exposed to the maximum thermal neutron flux in the moderating material. A second method of making optimum use of available neutrons is to shield the",702,11," imaging plane from non-neutron radiation ""no"
429,0,23949,0,"As Rockies fans braced for Todd Helton's potential exit this week, there was a bit of good news. ESPN.com ranked Colorado's farm system the second best in baseball. The reality, according to owner Charlie Monfort, is that the Rockies have no choice but to continue to develop young talent because they are not going to be able to keep it.

Failing to move a large chunk of Helton's contract to Boston - as unpopular as it may have been - leaves the Rockies in a difficult position as they try to retain young talent such as pitcher Aaron Cook, closer Brian Fuentes and, most notably, all-star outfielder Matt Holliday beyond this year.

Unless, that is, ownership greatly expands payroll, which it has shown no desire to do.

""It makes it tough. But who knows what's going to happen?"" Monfort said. ""People are already saying that we are not staying with homegrown guys (because of the Jason Jennings trade). But when we say we are going to stick with them, that doesn't mean through thick and thin for 12 to 14 years.

""That means you keep them while you can go through arbitration and hope that you have somebody coming behind them to take their place because, quite frankly, in this market we can't afford that. If people want to say that we are a minor-league team for the Yankees and somebody is going to pick Matt off for $14 (million) a year (as a free agent), so be it.""

Holliday, 27, isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2009 season. Until then, the team can go year-to-year in salary arbitration, as they did this season, but his salary could be expected to take huge swings upward, as it did this winter. Holliday will make $4.4 million this year, and with Helton ($16.6 million), pitcher Rodrigo Lopez ($4.325 million), Fuentes ($3.5 million) and Cook ($3.05 million) will constitute $31.8 million of the projected $55 million payroll, or 58 percent.

Allocating a high percentage of payroll to 20 percent of the roster is not conducive to producing a championship team. The Rockies were motivated to explore trading Helton to create more financial flexibility and address multiple needs. Helton, who has a no-trade clause in his contract, has squashed trade talks after they died this week.

With the Rockies' payroll in the bottom third of baseball, it's going to get more difficult to keep young players as they hit arbitration and free agency.

Fuentes, Holliday, third baseman Garrett Atkins, outfielder Brad Hawpe and possibly Cook - the team can exercise a buyout if he doesn't reach 187 1/3 innings - will be eligible for arbitration after this season, and pitcher Jeff Francis will earn $3 million next year as part of a new four-year contract.

As a result, the Rockies could be forced to make hard decisions, similar to the one faced when they traded Jennings, their No. 1 starter, this offseason to Houston for three young players, after failing to agree on a long-term contract.

""They have made a pretty strong statement with their payroll,"" Holliday said. ""If the payroll remains status quo, it's clear that logistically some of us aren't going to be around.""

The Rockies were burned by their monster contracts to Mike Hampton, Denny Neagle and Larry Walker years ago. Starting in 2004, the Rockies tried to reinvent themselves, adopting a small-payroll model perfected by the Oakland A's and Minnesota Twins, teams that frown on long-term deals. Those teams have advanced to the playoffs seven times in the past five years with average payrolls since 2000 that ranked 23rd (Minnesota) and 24th (Oakland), respectively.

Most teams with consistently similar payrolls and financial resources have failed. Tampa Bay has never been to the playoffs. Colorado last appeared in 1995, while Pittsburgh (1992), Kansas City (1985) and Milwaukee (1982) have suffered droughts. All have tried to rebuild through youth.

""If you don't have a lot of money, you might be able to put it together with some real good young players and mix in free agents here or there,"" said Tony La Russa, manager of the world champion St. Louis Cardinals. ""But it's pretty hard to sustain it because as soon as those young guys start",928,11," making money you can't afford to keep them.""

431,0,25656,1025," ν (/s) is mean aortic blood flow velocity during left ventricular ejection, LVET (s) is the left ventricular ejection time and HR (beat/min) is the heart rate. The Aesculon™ bioimpedance electrical cardiometry monitor (Osypka Medical GmbH, Berlin, Germany) is based on the EV formula.

Studies have been conducted to assess the accuracy of CO measurement using EV compared to thermodilution, Fick equation and transthoracic doppler echocardiography \[[@CR13]--[@CR16]\]. In post-cardiac surgical patients, the accuracy and interchangeability of electrical velocimetry with the thermodilution method has been demonstrated \[[@CR17]--[@CR20]\]. Rajput RS et al. applied the EV device during cardiac surgery and showed that the percentage error ranged from 22 to 32% \[[@CR21]\].

However, limited data are available to evaluate the accuracy and precision of EV during LDLT. The aim of this study is to assess whether non-invasive EV can replace the continuous thermodilution technique (by PAC) during LDLT.

Materials and methods {#Sec2}
=====================

This study was a prospective observational study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Medical Foundation in Taiwan (registration number: 201600264B0). Informed consent forms were obtained from all the participants of the study. Twenty-three patients undergoing LDLT in Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital between July 2016 and March 2017 were enrolled in this study. The exclusion criteria were preoperative atrial fibrillation, significant valvular pathology, intracardiac shunt, severe pulmonary hypertension and refusal to provide consent.

General anesthesia was started with propofol, 1 to 2 mg/kg; fentanyl, 1 to 2 mg/kg; and cisatracurium, 0.2 mg/kg or rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg. For the cardiac output measurement, the PAC was placed through the right internal jugular vein and a triple lumen central venous catheter was inserted through the left internal jugular vein. The tip position of the PAC was confirmed by the waveforms of pulmonary artery pressure. The PAC was connected to a Vigilance II Monitor (Edwards Lifesciences, USA). The continuous thermodilution machine measures CO every 30 s. CO measured by EV was obtained by the Aesculon™ monitor. After the PAC was inserted, four surface electrodes were applied to the patient according to the Aesculon™ protocol. As the triple lumen catheter was fixed on the left side of neck, two electrodes were applied on the left side of the cheek and neck. The other two electrodes were applied on the lower thorax. Only signals with adequate data quality were included in the analysis.

After the sensors were attached to the skin, the data were checked to ensure proper functioning of the sensors. The clock in the operation room, on the Aesculon™ and on the continuous thermodilution machine were synchronized. CO~Ev~ and CO~PAC~ were documented at nine time points: (1) immediately after PAC placement and calibration, T1; (2) 60--90 min after skin incision, T2; (3) 120--150 min after skin incision, T3; (4) immediately after removing the liver, T4; (5) 15 min after removing the liver, T5; (6) 30 min after removing the liver, T6; (7) immediately after releasing the inferior vena cava clamp, T7; (8) 15 min after releasing the inferior vena cava clamp, T8; (9) 30 min after releasing the inferior vena cava clamp, T9. The data were classified into three phases: dissection phase (T1-T3), anhepatic phase (T4-T6), and reperfusion phase (T7-T9).

During the LDLT, the partial clamp on the inferior vena cava (piggyback technique) was used in our hospital. Piggyback technique was proved to be a safer approach to venous outflow tract reconstruction from the hemodynamic point of view \[[@CR22]\].

The Self-Righteous Enforcers Of Political Correctness

Monday wasn’t a good day for free speech.

Google fired a senior engineer for writing a lengthy memo criticizing the lack of thought diversity at the company and overbearing political correctness. The termination initiated heated debate over free speech, with many seeing Google’s action as a disturbing infringement on their employees’ ability to speak their mind.

In a less noticed episode from Monday, seriously unfunny comedian Chelsea Handler tweeted out her desire for the arrest of all Americans who think racism is a laughing matter.

The Leinster man brilliantly fields the ball overhead with technique that is still not in the armoury of some international wings in the current game.

It couldn’t have been scripted any better, but the point is that this iconic moment in Irish rugby history was indeed scripted and then stunningly executed in the heat of the moment.

Kicking class

O’Gara’s sublime kick for Horgan’s try wasn’t the only lovely touch the Munster man had with the boot on that famous day at Croker.

While the out-half’s passing game was perhaps underrated – he had several beauties in this game – it was no surprise that ROG’s kicking ability played a prominent part in the contest against England.

Ireland went into half-time leading 23-3 and a large part of their success in the opening 40 minutes was down to the clever tactical kicking led by O’Gara.

We see one of his classic spirals to touch in the instance above, a skill that is increasingly absent in the game today. The sheer length O’Gara can get on the kick, while still keeping it low to the ground, is extremely impressive.

In this case, O’Gara [white circle above] identifies space in behind the inexperienced Strettle [red] and doesn’t hesitate for a second, firing the ball deep into the backfield and kicking with enough power to ensure that covering fullback Olly Morgan is not going to benefit from the ball bouncing up.

O’Gara’s deeply-practiced ability to find grass with his tactical kicking was essential for Ireland as they looked to ensure the game was played in England’s defensive territory.

With the Irish pack delivering a hugely muscular performance and posing a threat to the English lineout throw, Ireland’s kicking tactics were intelligent.

Having a man like O’Gara to calmly and accurately deliver on the plan was also essential.

Fronting up

The Irish pack was wonderfully led by a hungry Paul O’Connell, who was a mammoth at lineout time in particular.

The Munster lock was the primary target for Rory Best and also manage to cause havoc on George Chuter’s throw.

O’Connell’s performance was full of the kind of manic aggression he demanded from others – his big hit on Martin Corry from one restart was a highlight – but he combined that with intelligent focus.

Ireland’s success at the lineout, coached by Niall O’Donovan at that time, was a cornerstone of the success at Croker, and O’Connell’s ability to read the set-piece was important. The steal we see above was typical of his understanding.

Physically, Ireland were superior to the English pack too.

We get an illustration of that in the incident below, as Ireland pull off a choke tackle turnover – some time before Les Kiss arrived and was credited with its design.

Here, we see several of the key influencers of the day in action.

Props John Hayes and Marcus Horan initiate the tackle, part of a front row display that saw the Munster duo win scrum penalties and clear rucks tirelessly. Hooker Rory Best is next in to join his front row mates.

The abrasive and skillful Simon Easterby hammers into the contest, while the powerful Leamy is also present as Ireland hold Corry off the ground. Nearby and communicating are second row pair O’Connell and Donncha O’Callaghan. A cohesive pack effort.

While openside David Wallace is not involved here, he was an integral part of the Irish victory.

His close-range try was a ‘Wally’ special, as his incredible leg drive took him through contact to score.

Scrum-half Peter Stringer feeds Wallace in this instance, and his explosive power drives him right through Chuter and England loosehead Perry Freshwater.

Wallace’s physical prowess is crucial, but he also benefits from the running line of O’Callaghan to his left.

O’Callaghan’s run adds another slight distraction for Chuter and the England defence, as he thunders onto a possible pass from",926,11," Stringer.

In general, Internet-based commerce, often referred to as e-commerce, provides advantages to both suppliers and consumers. E-commerce provides vendors and service providers the ability to greatly increase their sales channel and distribution network with minimal cost. An Internet commerce site provides a convenient, effective and secure mechanism for potential buyers to browse, select and purchase goods or services in an easy and simple fashion.
An important consideration for owners and/or operators of web sites, which have been designed to handle Internet commerce, is the amount of web traffic flowing through the site.

Petitioner, Leonardo Q. Hernandez, appeals from an order of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.1 Hernandez has also moved to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal and for a certificate of probable cause.

In 1978, Hernandez was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. That judgment was affirmed on direct appeal. See State v. Hernandez, 227 Kan. 322, 607 P.2d 452 (1980). Hernandez first raised the issue addressed here in a post-conviction motion for relief. Relief was denied on the grounds of procedural default and on the merits. Because the state court denied Hernandez's motion on the alternative ground that Hernandez's failure to raise his post-conviction relief issue on direct appeal could not be excused as an exceptional circumstance thus permitting him to raise the issue for the first time in a post-conviction relief proceeding, the issue of procedural default may be available to respondents as a defense. Respondents did not raise this defense either below or on appeal. ""Therefore, we will deem the defense waived and will proceed to consider the petition on the merits."" Bailey v.

In his petition in federal district court, Hernandez alleged that the trial court gave the jury an unconstitutional instruction which shifted the burden of proving the element of intent to the defense. The district court agreed, but found the error harmless. Upon review, while we agree the instruction, as given, was unconstitutional, we do not find the error harmless and we reverse.

Detecting the locked table or row in SQL Server

I'm trying to understand/learn how to track down the details of a blocked session. 
So I created the following setup:
create table foo (id integer not null primary key, some_data varchar(20));
insert into foo values (1, 'foo');
commit;

Now I connect to the database twice from two different clients.
The first session issues: 
begin transaction
update foo set some_data = 'update'
  where id = 1;

I explicitly do not commit there in order to keep the locks. 
In the second session I issue the same statement and of course that one waits due to locking. Now I'm trying to use the different queries floating around in order to see that session 2 is waiting for the foo table. 
sp_who2 shows the following (I removed some columns to only show the important information):

SPID | Status       | BlkBy | DBName   | Command          | SPID | REQUESTID
-----+--------------+-------+----------+------------------+------+----------

53   | sleeping     |  .   | foodb    | AWAITING COMMAND | 53   | 0        
54   | SUSPENDED    | 52    | foodb    | UPDATE           | 54   | 0        
56   | RUNNABLE     |  .   | foodb    | SELECT INTO      | 56   | 0        

This is expected, session 54 is blocked by the un-committed changes from session 52. 
Querying sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks also shows this. The statement:
select session_id, wait_type, resource_address, resource_description
from sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks
where blocking_session_id is not null;

returns: 

session_id | wait_type | resource_address   | resource_description

Again this is expected. 
My problem is, that I can't figure out how to find the actual object name that session 54 is waiting for. 
I have found several queries that are joining sys.dm_tran_locks and sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks like this:
SELECT....
FROM sys.dm_tran_locks AS l
  JOIN sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks AS wt ON wt.resource_address = l.lock_owner_address

But in my above test scenario this join does not return anything. So either that join is wrong or dm_tran_locks doesn't actually contain the information I'm looking for.
So what I am looking for is a query that returns something like:  
""session 54 is waiting for a lock in table foo"".

Some background info:
The real life problem I'm trying to solve is a bit more complicated, but boils down to the question ""on which table is session 54 waiting for"". The problem in question involves a largish stored procedure that updates several tables and a select from a view that accesses some of those tables. The select statement is blocked even though we have snapshot isolation and read committed snapshot enabled. Figuring out why the select is blocked (which I thought would not be possible if snapshot isolation is enabled) will be the next step",978,11,".

Trigger ImportDefinition through WSProxy

I made a script (SSJS) to create a new Import Definition in Marketing Cloud. That works well, and if I then trigger the import manually in the GUI the import successfully completes.
However, I also want to start the ImportDefinition from my script, but I can't find how to do it.
This is how I (successfully) create an ImportDefinition:
var api = new Script.Util.WSProxy();
var importDef = {
    Name: ""CreatedDE_"" + CAMPAIGN_NAME,
    CustomerKey: NEW_GUID,
    AllowErrors: true,
    DestinationObject: { // DestinationObject?
        CustomerKey: DE_KEY
    },
    RetrieveFileTransferLocation: {
        CustomerKey: ""ExactTarget Enhanced FTP""
    },
    UpdateType: ""Overwrite"",
    FieldMappingType: ""InferFromColumnHeadings"",
    FileSpec: FILE_NAME, // set CSV file name
    FileType: ""CSV""
};
var res = api.createItem(""ImportDefinition"", importDef);

I can get the CustomerKey and the ObjectID from the res object after it is created. I tried to use that to start the ImportDefinition, like this (or CustomerKey or Name instead of ObjectID):
var res = api.performItem(""ImportDefinition"", { ObjectID: res.Results[0].NewObjectID },""start"",{});

But it always gives an error, with very descriptive Error Messages like:
Exception occurred during [Perform] ErrorID: 1646841981
The response of the performItem looks as follows. Only the ObjectID is initialized, so would that be an indication that it did not initialize the object properly?

Von Simone Miller

Ein Mann postet per Smartphone auf Facebook. (dpa / picture alliance / Luong Thai Linh)

Angesichts der Ressentiments, die in den sozialen Netzwerken herrschen, könnte man manchmal aus der Haut fahren. Dabei fühlen sich die Verfasser von Hass-Postings durch ihr persönliches Netzwerk noch bestärkt. Doch was tun? Die Diskursethik könnte helfen.

Blasen gibt und gab es auch im Analogen – zum Beispiel als Bild-Blase, faz-Blase, taz-Blase. Denn auch ein Zeitungsabonnement ist eine Form des weltanschaulichen Filters. Und keine von ihnen hat das Abendland je zum Platzen gebracht.

Es gibt allerdings einen gewaltigen Unterschied zwischen den Zeitungs- und den Social-Media-Blasen – die Zeitungen nehmen sich als gestalterisches Organ der Gesellschaft ernst. Sie gehen davon aus, dass ihre Inhalte zumindest in Teilen gesellschaftlich wirksam werden und dass sie deshalb Verantwortung für deren Vertretbarkeit tragen.

Anders die Facebook-Hater. Denen scheint es herzlich egal zu sein, ob ihre Forderungen gesellschaftlich vertretbar sind oder nicht. Das müsste den Rest der Welt nicht interessieren, griffe die rhetorische Raserei der digitalen Wutbürger nicht die Grundrechte einiger Mitmenschen und damit die Grundlagen der Demokratie an.

Cytoplasmic N-cadherin in DDR1−/− VSMCs was disrupted by Triton treatment {#s2c}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To further probe the localization of N-cadherins in DDR1+/+ and DDR1−/− VSMCs, we performed Triton extraction to determine the cellular compartments in which the N-cadherin proteins reside. This takes advantage of the fact that proteins in the cytoplasm, during synthesis, and recycling are Triton soluble, while stable membrane proteins are Triton insoluble. In DDR1+/+ VSMCs, Triton treatment did not disrupt N-cadherin cell--cell contacts, which remained in a zipper-like configuration at the cell periphery ([Fig. 4](#BIO041913F4){ref-type=""fig""}A). However, in DDR1−/− VSMCs, cytoplasmic N-cadherin staining was markedly reduced after Triton treatment, with more disruption occurring with increased concentration or time of Triton exposure ([Fig. 4](#BIO041913F4){ref-type=""fig""}A). This suggests more N-cadherin was present in the Triton soluble pool in DDR1−/− VSMCs. To measure the amount of N-cadherin present in Triton soluble versus insoluble fractions, DDR1+/+ and DDR1−/− VSMCs were lysed in 1% Triton, and N-cadherin protein levels were assessed by western blotting ([Fig. 4](#BIO041913F4){ref-type=""fig""} B,C). DDR1−/− VSMCs showed significantly higher levels of N-cadherin in the Triton soluble fraction compared to DDR1+/+ cells ([Fig. 4](#BIO041913F4){ref-type=""fig""}D). By contrast, the DDR1−/− cells had significantly less N-cadherin in the Triton insoluble fraction compared to DDR1 +/+ cells ([Fig. 4](#BIO041913F4){ref-type=""fig""}E).

Children in the parliamentary chambers

Dr Mark Rodrigues Politics and Public Administration Section

Executive summary

â¢ On 18 June 2009, the President of the Senate ruled that a child of a Senator be removed

from the chamber. Formal parliamentary procedures do not allow for senators or members to bring their children onto floor of the Senate and House of Representatives chamber. The only exception is for breastfeeding mothers in the Senate.

â¢ The rules on the admittance of visitors or ‘strangers’ within the parliamentary chambers

have a long history in the Westminster tradition of parliamentary practice. Only in the last 20 years have these ancient provisions been revised.

â¢ Over the past 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in the representation of women

in Parliament and some of them have given birth while in office. Since the 1990s a number of parents have defied the rules and brought a child onto the floor of the chamber.

â¢ In response to changing values, new procedures and facilities have been developed in

parliament that attempt to address the needs of senators and members who are parents of young children. These include the establishment of a childcare centre within Parliament House, measures to support breastfeeding and enabling proxy voting for nursing mothers in the House of Representatives.

â¢ The issue of allowing senators and members to take their children onto the floor of the

parliamentary chambers cuts across a number of conflicting values. These values concern the requirements of a modern workplace, the importance of a representative parliament, the need to provide a safe working environment free from disturbance and the importance of upholding the Westminster tradition of parliamentary practice.

On 18 June 2009, during the second reading debate on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising Bill 2006 [2008] in the Senate, a division was called on a motion from Greens’ leader Senator Bob Brown. Greens’ Senator Sarah Hanson-Young entered the chamber to vote carrying her two year old daughter. The President of the Senate ruled that the child be removed from the chamber.1 One of the senator’s staff then carried the crying child out of the chamber. Of the incident, Hanson-Young later remarked, ‘I don't think I've ever felt so humiliated in my life’.2

The President’s ruling was in accordance with the formal parliamentary procedures concerning access to the floor of the chamber for ‘strangers’ or visitors, that is, those who are not parliamentarians or authorised parliamentary staff. Senate Standing Order 174 enables the President to admit ‘distinguished visitors’ to the floor of the Senate, but only after gaining the concurrence of Senate. Otherwise, the chamber is restricted to senators, clerks at the table and attendants. Similar formal rules in relation to visitors apply in the House of Representatives. In 1995 Labor Senator Jacinta Collins was also asked to remove her child from the chamber.3 In Victoria, MLA Kirstie Marshall was asked to leave the Legislative Assembly during question time by the Serjeant-at-Arms when breastfeeding her new born infant in the chamber in 2003.4

However, the application of those rules has varied at times. Ms Anna Burke MP",716,11, brought her child into the chamber of the House of Representatives

For instance, Lacis (2010) says that three-quarters of the difference between emission temperature and today’s temperature is the feedback response to the non-condensing greenhouse gases: i.e, that the feedback fraction is 0.75, which, given the CMIP5 reference sensitivity of 1.1 K (Andrews 2012) would yield Charney sensitivity of 4.4 K. Sure enough, the CMIP5 models’ feedback fraction, at 0.67, is close to Lacis’ value, implying Charney sensitivity of 3.3 K. It will be proven that there is no justification whatever for mid-range estimates anything like this high. They arise solely because the models have been tuned over the decades to yield Charney sensitivities high enough to account for the entire 33 K.

Reference sensitivity is the temperature change in response to a radiative forcing before taking feedbacks into account.

, the warming expected to occur immediately in response to a forcing. The chief reason for the difference is the delay occasioned by the vast heat-sink that is the ocean. Charney sensitivity, named after Dr Jule Charney, is equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO 2.

Zero-dimensional-model equation relates reference and equilibrium sensitivities or temperatures via the feedback fraction, which accounts for the entire difference between them. Control theory in all applications except climatology uses both forms of (1) and of its rearrangement, (2), but climatology has not hitherto appreciated that the right-hand form of each equation is permissible. For this reason, it has failed to accord sufficient – or in most instances any – weight to the feedback response that arises from the presence of emission temperature. As a result of this grave error, official climatology has greatly overestimated the feedback fraction and hence all transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities.

Input variables

Input variables are from official sources. Net industrial-era anthropogenic radiative forcing to 2011 was 2.29 W m–2 (IPCC 2013, table SPM.5); the Planck sensitivity parameter is 3.2–2 K W–1 m2 (IPCC 2007, p. 631 fn.); the radiative energy imbalance to 2010 was 0.59 W m–2 (Smith 2015); industrial-era warming to 2011 was 0.75 K (least-squares trend on the HadCRUT4 monthly global mean surface temperature anomalies, 1850-2011: Morice 2012); and the radiative forcing at CO 2 doubling is 3.5 W m–2 (Andrews 2012); the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 5.6704 x 10–8 W m–2 K–4 (Rybicki 1979); albedo without non-condensing greenhouse gases or feedbacks would be 0.418 (Lacis 2010); global mean surface temperature without greenhouse gases would be 252 K (ibid.); and today’s global mean surface temperature is 288.4 K (ISCCP 2016).

Mid-range industrial-era Charney sensitivity

Now for the simplest proof of small Charney sensitivity. Net industrial-era manmade forcing to 2011 was 2.29 W m–2, implying industrial-era reference warming 2.29 / 3.2 = 0.72 K. The radiative imbalance to 2010 was 0.59 W m–2. Warming has thus radiated 2.29 – 0.59 = 1.70 W m–2 (74.",922,11,2%) to space. Equilibrium warming to 2011 may

Further in the article, Proffer offers the The Five A’s. method, “It’s helpful to think of resolving a dispute as a five-step process called the Five A’s: Acknowledge the problem. Apologize, even if you think you’re right. Accept responsibility. Adjust the situation with a negotiation to fix the problem. Assure the customer that you will follow through.”

Well trained staff

Training is paramount and well trained staff needs to help customers resolve their problems regardless of how much time they have spent resolving it (within reason). Many organisations tend to operate their measuring metrics for customer services advisors’ on calls closed rather than calls resolved. Well trained staff will have the ability to resolve calls and close them better than ill trained staff. Staff training should be reviewed periodically and refresher courses offered based around lessons learnt, processes improved and latest innovations in delivering better customer service.

Catherine Lovering in her article on customer service said, “Teach the staff stress-reduction methods and techniques in conflict resolution. Train staff to use language that promotes good customer service. Phrases such as “How can I help,” “I don’t know, but I will find out,” and “I will keep you updated” let customers know that their needs will be met. It also will demonstrate a willingness to find a solution to any problem and a commitment to communicate with the customer. This dedication will go a long way toward defusing dissatisfaction among clientele.”

She further adds, “Train staff to accept responsibility for errors and to apologize to upset customers. Good customer-service representatives must refrain from arguing with an upset customer and instead ask the customer what they can do to solve the problem. Advise employees to speak calmly to customers and to assure them that they’ll do what they can to help. Follow up with a clear resolution to the complaint.”

Catherine Lovering says, “Empower these staff members to not only deal well with upset customers on an emotional level but also to provide tangible benefits. For example, “Entrepreneur” magazine recommends giving employees the authority to give any dissatisfied customer a 10-percent discount.”

The emphasis should be on, “What can we do that will make the situation better for you? Add the wow factor –“For example, one winner of The WOW! Awards is a restaurant in Leeds called Gueller’s. They keep a range of prescription spectacles, just in case customers forget their own and are having difficulty reading the menu.”

Give them something that will make them feel valuable. That could be a freebie, the",621,11," ability to resolve their problem, following up the matter on"

Bee over at Rasa Malaysia has a fantastic blog that not only covers Malaysian food, but foods from all over the Asian continent. While the photos, writing and recipes are superb, that’s not what I love about her blog.

I’m all for exploring new foods and experimenting with them (that’s what No Recipes is all about), but I think there’s a certain level of respect that needs to be paid to time honored dishes. I see too many recipes floating around where the soul of the dish has been lost in translation. Rasa Malaysia takes the time to capture the essence of a dish, elaborating on its variations, ingredients and origins, which is why it’s one of my favourite blogs.

In areas where she’s less familiar Bee asks guest bloggers to come in and take the reins. When she asked me to write a post on Japanese food, I jumped at the chance to talk a bit about my childhood, Japanese cuisine, and a bowl of noodle soup. What do these three things have in common you ask? Head over to Rasa Malaysia to find out:-)

Hey Marc, thanks for the teaser post and it’s great to have you on Rasa Malaysia. No Recipes is a real gem and hopefully my readers will discover your blog and learn more about Japanese food.

i’m so pleased you guest posted on Rasa Malaysia. Her blog is really amazing. I like how she writes and goes so in depth into food. Lovely photo of udon and there’s nothing quite like a simple, steaming bowl of udon that makes things right. I got a little nervous when you mentioned some dishes getting lost in translation – somehow I am quite sure I’m sometimes guilty of that! eeekk! x

LOL, no need to be nervous, you always have ample disclaimers when you’re not sure about something:-)

452,0,24791,2050," is really something to be said for being on the
highest peak around, particularly when that peak is pretty prominent:
you can see forever. We walk for a bit and then rejoin the crowds
heading for the peak (1344m). At the peak itself we amuse ourselves with
the chaos and the views (including a great look back on the Ledge
Route) before turning around and starting the long trip back down.

views, snow, cloud

For
the trip down we follow the standard tourist route, zigging and zagging
with a bunch of other people back down to the valley. Eventually we
make it back to our car. After changing shoes and quick rest we pile in
and head back to Fort William for a shower and dinner.

on the way down with lots of others...

This
was a really nice trip: not nearly as challenging for either route
finding or scrambling as the day before, but with a much more remote
feeling while we were on that ridge. The contrasts from masses of
people, to solitary ridge scramble, and then back to masses of people
was fun.

Monday, May 23, 2016

Today we return to the very impressive east face of the Buachaille
Etive Mor. We saw this as we were driving towards Glen Coe on the first
day and took a couple pictures, today's the day to climb it (well, to
scramble up it).

in front of Buachaille
Etive Mor while driving in

After parking we head along a service road
towards the face of the mountain, past a small house with a parking lot
(complete with guy who's camped there overnight) and a van with three
guys clearly planning on climbing. Onward we go, across the plain and
then slowly starting to climb as we cross in front of the rock face.
After going what seems like further than we should have needed to (and
checking with the GPS map once, we're bad), we pass in front of the
""waterfall slab"", move on a bit further, and then follow a track steeply
up. This isn't as well traversed as it seems like it ought to be (or we
just have problems following it), so it takes us longer to find our way
here than it seems like it should. We eventually hit a wall where we'd
need to keep scrambling to continue. Since we think we're not quite
there, and since a peek at the GPS map shows us pretty far off where the

No. 01-1393.
United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.
Argued February 11, 2003.
Decided March 28, 2003.

COPYRIGHT MATERIAL OMITTED Robert W. Tollen argued the cause and filed the briefs for petitioner.
William M. Bernstein, Senior Attorney, National Labor Relations Board, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Arthur F. Rosenfeld, General Counsel, John H. Ferguson, Associate General Counsel, Aileen A. Armstrong, Deputy Associate General Counsel, and Meredith Jason, Attorney. Deirdre C. Fitzpatrick and Julie F. Marcus, Attorneys, entered appearances.
Robert D. Kurnick argued the cause for the intervenor unions and amicus curiae International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO in support of respondent. With him on the brief was David Hannah.
Before: EDWARDS and ROGERS, Circuit Judges, and SILBERMAN, Senior Circuit Judge.
Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge SILBERMAN.
SILBERMAN, Senior Circuit Judge:


1
Contractors' Labor Pool (CLP) challenges a Board determination that CLP's policy of refusing to hire applicants whose recent wages were 30% higher or lower than its starting wages was discriminatory within the meaning of § 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act. Also challenged is the Board's conclusion that CLP discriminated against several paid union organizers in assignment because, according to petitioner, they were not its ""employees"" or, alternatively, because of a ""disabling conflict,"" they were engaged in unprotected activity. We agree with petitioner's first challenge but reject its second and therefore grant the petition in part and deny it in part.

I.

2
CLP, a nonunion company, supplies, on a temporary basis, several thousand construction workers a year to various contractors in Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, and Colorado.1 It operates 15 offices in those states. Essentially, it employs a permanent labor pool from which contractors draw skilled and unskilled workers as needed. Its management believes that its success depends on its ability to keep a large number of reliable employees. Accordingly, it has adopted various measures to improve employee retention (and productivity) since its inception in 1987.


3
For instance, it sought to improve its applicant screening process in the early 1990s by examining applicants' driving records and references with greater care. And beginning in 1989, an applicant was asked to specify an acceptable hourly rate. If the figure was substantially higher than CLP was willing to pay, that person would not be hired for it was assumed that the employee would soon become dissatisfied and quit. Petitioner's CEO Thomas McCune testified that short-term employees, moreover, were prone to substandard work and accidents.


4
In 1993 the company conducted a worker retention study that served to further refine petitioner's hiring policy. The available data indicated that workers who had previously earned wages that were either 30% higher or lower than CLP's wages would be significantly less likely to work for the company for 100 hours or more within a 40-day period. The study predicted that adopting a 30% rule (precluding applicants whose prior wages deviated by 30% from CLP's starting salary) would eliminate some eligible workers. But it would cause CLP's important retention rate to rise 3.5%. Accordingly, in 1994 CLP adopted the 30% hiring standard. In the first full year following adoption of the 30% rule the percentage of applicants deemed ineligible for hire increased from 70 to 75%, but CLP's retention rate increased from 57.6 to 63.9%, workers compensation costs were significantly reduced, and the company's safety record showed substantial improvement.


5
The ALJ specifically determined that petitioner's implementation of its 30%",860,11, rule was not motivated by antiunion animus; instead

       Per Curiam—Pierce DuBois appeals his convictions for second degree

murder and first degree unlawful possession of a firearm. He contends that the

from the evidence that each of these elements has been proved beyond a

reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty."" According

to DuBois, the court should have instructed the jury that it ""may"" convict because

there is no ""duty to convict"" under federal and Washington state law.

Political diversity in US Atheist Movements

Much is made of the lack of diversity in atheist, secular and skeptic movements within the USA.

However, there is some irony wrapped up in the fact that those who shout for an increase in diversity the loudest also seem to be hell bent on on narrowing the political spectrum represented to the exclusion of those who are politcally right wing or central by tying atheism into a particular set of sociopolitical beliefs

Part of the justification for this seems to be that in the USA the conservative right shows far greater levels of religiosity than the left, so the expectation comes that one would expect less from the politcal right to attend.

So why is this not being challenged?

When Greta Christina recently tackled Sam Harris on the numbers of women who read his books she was very quick to point out that the male-female balance of atheism in the USA was not mirrored around the world, thus (at least in terms of her argument) showing that the assumption that this status quo is an inevitability is something to do more about than simply shrug your shoulders.

So why do these same people see atheism as ""largely a left-wing thing"" (paraphrasing there)?

As you can clearly see, 44% of the major right wing party are of no religion as opposed to 46% of the major left wing party. Hardly any difference to speak of and clear evidence that a left-right split in lack of religiosity is far from a foregone conclusion and an axis along which diversity can be pursued.

So whilst it is a laudable goal for atheist movements to try and increase representation amongst underrepresented groups by making sure they feel welcome, is it really consistent to do exactly the opposite with those on the political right by going out of your way to make them feel LESS welcome? Shouldn't these conferences be making sure that right wing speakers take to the platform alongside left wing speakers? Or is diversity something that only gets lip service and when the group in question is one you don't like you quietly forget about it?

9 comments:

While you have painted a fairly convincing argument about the Left-Right spectrum in the UK and perhaps overseas as well (such as in my country Australia) i think the description of the Right as more religious in the US than other countries is a fair one.

Part of the problem from my perspective is that trying to draw Left-Right spectrums across various countries can be at times problematic. tbh the whole Left-Right spectrum is pretty poorly defined.

As an example, compare the Moderate Left and Moderate Right parties in your country(UK for e.g.) with those of one of the countries often considered left leaning (say one of the Scandinavian countries) and then compare that to the US which is often considered right leaning.In the most extreme you might see things that would be considered extremely left leaning in one country being a policy platform of another right wing political party in another.

So when someone is in the US and says they dont like the ideology of the Right i see that differently to",676,11," someone in the Australia saying the same thing.

For example, in a zone where the frequency of the commercial AC power is 50 Hz, a subject may be photographed by a CCD camera of an NTSC method (at a 60 Hz vertical synchronization frequency) under the illumination of the non-inverter fluorescent lamp. In such a case as shown in FIG. 28, one field frequency is 1/60 second while the period of the luminance change of the fluorescent lamp is 1/100 second. The exposure timing at each field drifts with respect to variations in the luminance of the fluorescent lamp, and an amount of exposure light at each pixel changes from field to field.
If the exposure time is 1/60 second, the amount of exposure light is different within the same exposure time from duration a1 to duration a2 to duration a3, and when the exposure time is shorter than 1/60 second (but not 1/100 second), the amount of exposure light time is different within the same exposure from duration b1 to duration b2 to duration b3.
Since the exposure timing responsive to the luminance change of the fluorescent lamp reverts back to the original timing every three fields, the brightness level variation due to flickering is repeated every three fields. More specifically, the luminance ratio of each field (the appearance of a flicker) changes within an exposure period, but the period of flickering remains unchanged.
In a progressive camera such as a digital camera, the brightness level variation is repeated every three frames if the vertical synchronization frequency is 30 Hz",396,11,".

I have got so many stamps that don't see the light of day - it's ridiculous....so when I was asked to make a card for a friend's daughter I decided to dust down one of my stamps that hasn't seen the light for a long time.....LCI Cupcake Cutie....which was quite fitting as my friend makes cakes for a living.....The backing paper is from Nitwits - I just love their papers. The ribbon is one one I found in my stash which I bought ages and ages ago from a little company called Tapestry of Delights.....the nestie is one of my purchases from a craft show I went to whilst I was in Australia - it is gorgeous....A paper pieced cupcake wrapper and dress - can you believe I hadn't paper pieced up until joining LCI - now I love it!! Lots of pink and lots of glitter just what a 6 year old little girl needs....

467,0,23329,0,"Diplomatic work continues in some of the areas with the highest geopolitical tensions in the world. In recent days there have been high-level meetings and contacts between Turkey, Iran and Russia over the situation in Syria; meetings between Modi and Xi Jinping to ease tensions between India and China; and finally, the historic meeting between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un. The common component in all these meetings is the absence of the United States, which may explain the excellent progress that has been seen.

The last seven days have brought a note of optimism to international relations. The meeting between Modi and Xi Jinping in China offered a regional example, confirmed by the words of Wang Yi, member of the State Counsel of the People's Republic of China:

""Our [India and China] common interests outweigh our differences. The summit will go a long way towards deepening the mutual trust between the two great neighbors. We will make sure that the informal summit will be a complete success and a new milestone in the history of China-India relations"".

Given the tensions in August 2017 in the Himalayan border area between the two countries, the progress achieved in the last nine months bodes well for a further increase in cooperation between the two nations. Bilateral trade stands at around $85 billion a year, with China as India’s largest trading partner. The meeting between Modi and Xi also serves to deepen the already existing framework between the two countries in international organizations like BRICS, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), in which they are integral participants. It is imaginable that negotiations on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be in full swing, with Beijing keen to involve New Delhi more in the project. Such a prospect is particularly helped by three very powerful investment vehicles put in place by Beijing, namely, the New Development Bank (formerly the BRICS Development Bank), the AIIB, and the Silk Road Fund.

Xi Jinping will be seeking to ​​progressively entice India closer to the BRI project through attractive and mutually beneficial commercial arrangements. However, this objective remains complicated and difficult to implement. Beijing is aware of this and has already expressed its intention not to impose the BRI on the neighboring country. With much of the future global and regional architecture depending on these two countries, the good understanding shown between Xi Jinping and Modi bodes well, especially given the commonly aligned objectives represented by the multitude of international organizations and frameworks on which China and India sit side by side.

Another bit of important news for the Asian region has been the meeting between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un, which was recently examined in an article published in Strategic Culture Foundation. As discussed in that article, the intention of the two leaders is to reunite the two Koreas, to denuclearize the peninsula, and to sign a peace treaty between the North and South, whose unprecedented implications entail such questions as whether there is a future role of for the United States on the peninsula. As stated before, the rapprochement between the two Koreas does not play into Washington’s favor, which relies on the South as a strategic foothold to contain China, justifying its presence on the purported need to confront North Korea. With an all-encompassing peace agreement, this justification would cease to exist. It seems that the goal for US policy-makers will be to find an opportunity to sabotage the North-South agreement and blame Kim Jong",710,11,-un for its failure. Without engaging in a diplomatic

============

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), one of the most common and deadliest forms of proliferative neoplasms, is established through a stepwise acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that result in the malignant transformation of haematopoietic progenitor cells ([@bib15]; [@bib21]). Often, AML arises through the collaboration between mutations affecting transcription factors (e.g., CEBPA, PU.1, and RUNX1) and signalling proteins (such as FLT3, RAS, and KIT) that lead to an aberrant proliferation capacity coupled with a disruption of terminal myeloid differentiation ([@bib38]; [@bib30]).

C/EBPα, a leucine zipper transcription factor with a known tumour suppressor function, has been demonstrated to play an important role in granulocytic development and in the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis ([@bib27], [@bib26]; [@bib47]; [@bib17]; [@bib43]; [@bib45]). C/EBPα is translated as two major isoforms, namely a full-length 42-kD form (p42) and a truncated 30-kD protein (p30) that arises from a downstream translational initiation codon ([@bib19]). Mutations in the *CEBPA* gene are frequently associated with leukaemia, being found in 8--14% of all de novo AML with normal karyotype ([@bib22]; [@bib18]; [@bib33]) and typically involve both alleles. C/EBPα-mutant proteins are classified into two major groups: (i) C-terminal insertions or deletions within the basic region leucine zipper DNA-binding domain; and (ii) N-terminal mutations that lead to the complete ablation of p42 while retaining normal p30 function ([@bib24]; [@bib18]; [@bib8]). Most patients carrying *CEBPA* mutations harbour one allele with an N-terminal mutation and one with a C-terminal mutation, with homozygosity for N- or C-terminal mutations being less common ([@bib10]; [@bib23]). Furthermore, several reports have demonstrated that biallelic mutations of *CEBPA* are associated with a favourable outcome, when not found in association with FLT3-activating mutations ([@bib28]; [@bib7]).

Efforts aimed at understanding how mutations or oncoproteins may cooperate in driving the leukaemogenesis have pointed to cooperation between C/EBPα and other transcription factors, such as RUNX1, MYB, and PU.1. We have previously demonstrated the functional cooperation of Myb and C/EBPα in the regulation of the *Flt3* gene in both haematopoietic and leukaemia stem cells ([@bib41], [@bib40]). Our studies indicated that Myb and C/EBPα act cooperatively through their combined activity on promoter and intronic elements in the *Flt3* gene ([@bib41]). Furthermore, we reported a strong linear correlation between expression of the two transcription factors and *FLT3* RNA levels in human CN-AML, adding to an increasing body of evidence that points to MYB being a crucial component of leukaemia maintenance and oncogene addiction ([@bib13]; [@bib50]; [@bib6]).

Our findings on the cooperation of Myb and C/EBPα in",796,11, *Flt3* gene regulation prompted us to investigate

============

Mostly, the amino acid sequence of a protein is conserved in order to maintain its function and structure. However, the conservation may also be caused by the selection at the nucleic acid level due to essential cis-acting sequences located in the protein-coding region. Thus, certain regions in a protein-coding sequence might encode specific amino acids not because of the selective pressure to the amino acid sequence, but because of the conservation at the nucleic acid level in DNA or RNA. There can be multiple reasons: the existence of nucleic acid secondary structures, splice sites, binding sites for proteins (e.g. transcription factors) or short RNAs, internal promoters, ribosome frameshifting signals, subgenomic promoters in RNA viruses, viral",160,11," packaging signals and other regulatory elements.

The present invention relates to jacks and more particularly pertains to a new dual hydraulic jack system for more quickly raising the jack up to a load to be lifted.
2. Description of the Prior Art
The use of jacks is known in the prior art. More specifically, jacks heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
Known prior art includes U.S. Pat. No. 4,161,229; U.S. Pat. No. 5,918,860; U.S. Pat. No. 5,975,496; U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,094; U.S. Pat. No. 4,506,867; and U.S. Pat. No. Des. 313,492.
While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a new dual hydraulic jack system. The inventive device includes a base and a dual pump assembly mounted on a top of the base. The dual pump assembly comprises an inner piston assembly movably positioned in a first fluid chamber and an outer piston assembly movably positioned in a second fluid chamber. A jack assembly is provided for lifting a load. The jack assembly includes a jack piston assembly that is movably positioned in a third fluid chamber. A reservoir is provided for holding fluid in an interior of the reservoir. A first fluid channel is provided for providing fluid communication between the first, second and third fluid chambers. A second fluid channel is provided for providing fluid communication between the reservoir and the first and second fluid chambers. A first conduit is provided for providing fluid communication between the reservoir and the third fluid chamber. A plurality of valves is provided for controlling unidirectional flow of the fluid through the first and second fluid channels.
In these respects, the dual hydraulic jack system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of more quickly raising the jack up to a load to be lifted.
In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of jacks now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new dual hydraulic jack system construction wherein the same can be utilized for more quickly raising the jack up to a load to be lifted.
The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new dual hydraulic jack system apparatus and method which has many of the advantages of the jacks mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a new dual hydraulic jack system which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art jacks, either alone or in any combination thereof.
To attain this, the present invention generally comprises a base and a dual pump assembly mounted on a top of the base. The dual pump assembly comprises an inner piston assembly movably positioned in a first fluid chamber and an outer piston assembly movably positioned in a second fluid chamber. A jack assembly is provided for lifting a load. The jack assembly includes a jack piston assembly that is movably positioned in a third fluid chamber. A reservoir is provided for holding fluid in an interior of the reservoir. A first fluid channel is provided for providing fluid communication between the first, second and third fluid chambers. A second fluid channel is provided for providing fluid communication between the reservoir and the first and second fluid chambers. A first conduit is provided for providing fluid communication between the reservoir and the third fluid chamber. A plurality of valves is provided for controlling unidirectional flow of the fluid through the first and second fluid channels.
There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.
In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the",911,11, drawings.

Is this site for experts, or not?

On the one hand, this question here about what RPG.SE is, and this answer here about answering FATE questions, specify ""[this site] is a collection of expert knowledge"" and ""Expert questions to be answered by Experts"". On the other hand, the help page states

Anybody can ask a question
Anybody can answer

and this answer has several newbie-friendly nuggets of wisdom. This question is encouraging, too.
In the question about FATE, one bit of an answer stated:

It seems like people are so bogged down with non-expert fate questions
that the first instinct is to give an answer suited for a beginner in
the system and not an expert.

This points out that there are non-experts asking questions, that they are many (how are they bogging down people otherwise?), and that they aren't really welcome (at least, not by the answerer): they ask the ""wrong"" sort of questions.
So which is it?
I ask because I'm not an expert on D&D 4E, 2E, Numenera or Fiasco. I just play and GM them. I have very limited time and chances to play, often having dry spells of months between 4-hour sessions. I enjoy rereading my corebooks and splats, but without actual playtime, my questions and answers will never actually be of ""expert level"".
The help page is inclusive, and makes me feel I can actually ask questions here. The first answers and comments cited don't, they make me feel that I can at best lurk and check from time to time if something interesting shows up. In the end, I feel I'm almost restating this question, though not exactly.

A:

If you play RPGs, you're an expert and welcome.
The line ""Asking Expert questions, getting expert answers"" has a particular history dating to when it was just the original three sites. ""Expert questions"" was important because they didn't want to teach askers the basics of how to program. Being an expert meant that you already knew how to program and what programming meant.
The parallel here isn't perfect, so those words aren't so meaningful here.

Diabetes mellitus represents an expanding pandemic that contributes markedly to worldwide morbidity and mortality. The world prevalence of diabetes among adults (aged 20--79 years) will be 6.4%, affecting 285 million adults, in 2010 and will increase to 7.7% and 439 million adults by 2030 \[[@B1]\]. There is a strong relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) \[[@B2]\]. In a large USA population study, the prevalence of diabetes increases with increasing weight classes according to body mass index (BMI). Approximately half of those diagnosed with T2DM are obese \[[@B3]\]. Weight control is the key to successful T2DM management. Weight loss achieved by lifestyle interventions has been shown to be effective in preventing and treating T2DM \[[@B4]--[@B7]\]. However, conventional treatment, such as, lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy has produced small improvements in weight \[[@B7]--[@B10]\]. By contrast, bariatric surgery has been shown to effectively provide durable weight loss \[[@B11]\].

Currently, bariatric surgery is now considered appropriate for T2DM patient with BMI ≧ 35 kg/m^2^. Bariatric surgery leads to remission of T2DM in the majority of patients and improvement in the rest \[[@B12]\]. The American Society of Bariatric and Metabolic surgery estimates that the number of bariatric procedures increased from about 16,000 in the early 1990s to more than 103,000 in 2003 and 220,000 people in the United States had bariatric surgery in 2008. Growing evidence from clinical and animal studies indicates that bariatric/metabolic surgery may be beneficial for T2DM in nonseverely obese or even nonobese patients (BMI \< 35 kg/m^2^) \[[@B13], [@B14]\].

This is a child custody dispute. The Trial Judge changed custody from the mother to the father and the mother appeals.
We first note that appellant's brief does not comply with Rule 27 T.R.A.P. The brief does not contain a statement of the issues presented for review as required by the Rule. Instead, under the heading of Argument there are posed general questions such as ""Were the factors the Judge considered in his decision for a change of custody proper?"" followed by an argument in favor of an affirmative response to the query. To answer such a query requires a degree of clairvoyance with which this Court is not possessed.
The only issue presented by this appeal and the only one we consider is whether the evidence supports the ruling of the Trial Judge that it was in the best interest of the minor child that custody be for now changed.
The minor child is a boy, approximately three years of age. In the divorce proceedings custody was awarded the mother, with visitation rights in the father. The parents have squabbled over the exercise of those rights since the divorce. Various proceedings, including those for contempt, have been filed or are pending. However, the proceeding now appealed from is the hearing on the father's petition for change of custody and we will confine this opinion to matters that bear on that issue, although the proof is liberally sprinkled, if not saturated, with evidence on other issues.
Sometime after the mother was awarded custody of the child, she moved to the state of Louisiana with a male friend to whom she is now married and living with in that state. The order of custody did not forbid the mother to leave the state, but did order her to notify the father if she did leave. She failed to notify the father and secreted herself and the child in Louisiana for several months.

Extended Cox proportional hazards model analysis {#sec006}
------------------------------------------------

We examined the effects of sex, age at capture, CWD status, and *Prnp* genotype on weekly survival probability. An extended Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine which variables had the most influence on annual survival of deer \[[@pone.0186512.ref029],[@pone.0186512.ref034]\]. The analyses were performed using the *coxph* function in R \[[@pone.0186512.ref031]\]. Time-dependent variables were created for CWD status and age as both changed through time for individual deer during the study \[[@pone.0186512.ref029]\]. Proportional hazards assumption was tested using the *cox*.*zph* function, which evaluates correlation between the Schoenfeld residuals and survival time \[[@pone.0186512.ref031]\]. Covariates failed proportionality when their p-value ≤ 0.05 \[[@pone.0186512.ref029]\]. Stepwise forward and backward selection of models were performed using the function *stepAIC* in the package *MASS* v.7.3--31 \[[@pone.0186512.ref035]\]. Models were ranked based on Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) values \[[@pone.0186512.ref036]\].

As I have said, the material in this book is incredibly detailed and completed, but what really makes this book worth 5 stars is that the information is presented in a non-biased way. According to the introduction, McDonald wrote this book to clear confusion about ketogenic diets, not to champion them. Much of the material is accompanied by research references and McDonald clearly states where research is lacking or where he is offering his own opinion.

Overall, “The Ketogenic Diet” will make an excellent addition to any dieter’s collection of reading. Also, if you are considering a ketogenic diet this will gives you an unbiased view of how they really work.”

Douglas – Seattle, WA

“People that opted for a low-carb lifestyle are actually making a life-or-death decision on their own lives. It does not help that there are a lot of misinformation around it, specially suggesting that you will have all sort of health complications because of it.

This is a very complete book on the subject. It explains the physiology around a ketogenic diet. It’s well researched and full of references. It leans toward athletes but anyone could learn a lot from it.

This book does not tell you how to follow a Ketogenic diet. For that purpose I would recommend “Protein Power”.

MusicPlayer issues in Android (Beginner)

I have an issue with an app I'm creating. 
Basically, I am trying to have music playing in the background of my app, which I can do and it plays fine. However, when the user changes to another screen, the music restarts instead of just continuing as normal. 
Here is all the code I have currently:
public class MainActivity extends Activity {    

MediaPlayer mp;

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
    //setting the layout

    mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.song);
    mp.setLooping(true);
    mp.getDuration();
    mp.start();

I then have this method at the end of this class to stop the music when the app is closed:
@Override
protected void onPause() {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    super.onPause();

    mp.release();
    finish();

}

I am unsure of what to include in my other classes so the music continues playing. If anyone could show me I'd be very appreciative. 
Thank you.

A:

You have made your Mediaplayer instance dependent on the Activity. So when Activity gets restarted, onCreate() gets called again and the music restarts. If you want to continue playing music, take the mp out of any Activity instance and put it inside a Service. Then start the Service from your MainActivity and let it play the music unless you stop the Service.
  public class MainActivity extends ListActivity {

    /** Called when the activity is first created. */

              // Perform action on clicks    
              if (togglebutton.isChecked()) {

486,0,29520,0,"TAMPA — Ashley Iovinelli of Woodridge, Ill., recently joked that she would do whatever it takes to see her beloved Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup final.

The Tampa Bay Lightning are making sure she has to do just that.

To keep Amalie Arena blue all playoffs, the Lightning front office has pursued an aggressive ticket strategy that blocks people with out-of-state credit cards from purchasing tickets through the team's Ticketmaster portal. Only Floridians, who are presumably Lightning fans, can buy tickets directly.

""We've done everything we can to preserve a hometown environment, and we're relatively happy with what we've done so far,"" said Bill Wickett, executive vice president of communications for the Lightning.

The policy has irked opposing fans all playoffs, and Chicagoans are the most recent victims.

""It's bad sportsmanship,"" said Iovinelli, who has family in Florida and is planning to attend Game 5 (if necessary) on June 13 with her husband and parents. ""This is big. This is the playoffs. It's not this competition to see who can get the most fans. It's about watching hockey, so it's very frustrating.""

The Lightning first tested the strategy last year when it restricted international ticket sales during the playoff series against the Montreal Canadiens.

In addition to the ticket rules, anyone who sits in the pricey Chase Club and Lexus Lounge, about 1,400 seats, is prohibited from wearing opposing team apparel. If they do, they'll be asked to change clothes or will be moved into another area of the arena.

The policies follow a trend of professional sports teams, particularly in smaller markets, taking steps to ensure their fans have first dibs on home tickets. The rules were stated on Ticketmaster and have been in place for all four rounds of the playoffs.

But word of the policy made its way for the first time to Chicago on Monday, where it was met with outrage and accusations of foul play. The policy wasn't created to specifically target Chicago's faithful, who travel as well as or better than any NHL team's, but it was taken as a slight by their fans.

It's particularly vexing in Chicago because fans there have experienced this before. For years, the Nashville Predators have adopted similar strategies to keep red and black sweaters out of their arena. Anyone looking to get into a regular season game against the Blackhawks had to purchase an additional ticket to another game. The two teams clashed in the playoffs this year. The Predators blocked Illinois ticket sales, too.

Longtime Chicago sports talk radio host Dan Bernstein slammed the Lightning's ticketing strategy in a column that went viral among incensed Blackhawks followers on social media.

""This kind of ridiculous behavior ignores the speed and power of the secondary market to get tickets in the hands of those most motivated to attend, which in the end will be a contingent of Chicagoans large enough to unsettle the nervous Mr. Wickett and others,"" Bernstein wrote.

Bernstein is a well-known agitator in Chicago, but, in regard to the resale market, he might have a point.

The Lightning can't restrict who buys tickets using online resale websites such as eBay, StubHub or Craigs­list.

Illinois residents so far make up 20 percent of all tickets purchased for Game 1 on StubHub, said Cameron Papp, spokesman for the online ticket exchange. That far outpaces the norm; the home state of the visiting squad usually accounts for only 5 to 8 percent of sales, Papp said.

The markup on those sites is considerable — the cheapest seats run for $335 on StubHub, while it costs nearly $5,000 to sit right behind the glass — but it appears",783,11, Blackhawks fans are willing to pay it. Iovinelli

When choosing the types of chickens you want you have lots of size options, ranging from less than 1 pound to upwards of 13 pounds (yes, seriously).

Sneak a peak. It is essential that your audience doesn’t notice you peep at the bottom card. You’ll need to memorize the bottom card. Act casual and show them the top of the deck while you look at the bottom.[2]

Cut the deck in half. Place the bottom half on top of the card placed on top. This puts the card you memorized directly on top of their card. You can do as many cuts as you want, as long as they are single cuts.

Look through the cards. Pretend to look for jokers and take them out, but also find the card you memorized. Their card is resting directly on top of it. Cut the deck again so that their card is on top.

Cutting the deck a second time may take a few trials and errors before doing it seamlessly.[4]

Finish the trick. Have them pick a number between ten and twenty. Deal that many cards off the top of the deck. Take that amount of cards and hold them between your thumb and pointer, have them slap the cards and the one farthest to the left should be their card.

Prepare your deck. You will need a deck with two Jokers in it. Before the trick has begun, find both of the Jokers and place one on the top and one on the bottom of the deck. Now the trick is ready to be performed![6]

489,0,27811,0,"Prince Albert (genital piercing)

The Prince Albert (PA) is one of the most common male genital piercings. The PA is ""a ring-style piercing that extends along the underside of the glans from the urethral opening to where the glans meets the shaft of the penis."" The related ""reverse Prince Albert piercing"" enters through the urethra and exits through a hole pierced in the top of the glans.

While some piercers may choose to avoid the nerve bundle that runs along the center of the frenulum altogether, others may choose otherwise. The piercing can be centred if the bearer is circumcised. Otherwise, the piercing must be done off-centre so that the surrounding skin can reposition itself.

Healing and potential side effects
The Prince Albert healing time can take from 4 weeks to 6 months. A fresh PA piercing may cause bleeding, swelling and inflammation. In rare cases, it can lead to local infections. Some men find that the dribble caused by the PA when urinating necessitates sitting down to urinate. With practice, some men can control the stream while standing.

Some PA wearers report it enhances sexual pleasure for both partners. However, others penetrated by males with this piercing report discomfort. PA rings can cause additional discomfort to female partners in cases when the penis comes in contact with the cervix. Sexual partners of those with piercings may experience complications during oral sex such as chipped teeth, choking, foreign bodies getting stuck between the partner's teeth, and mucosal injury to receptive partners.

As with many piercings, there is risk of the jewelry becoming caught on clothing and being pulled or torn out. Very large gauge or heavy jewelry can cause thinning of the tissue between the urethral opening and the healed fistula resulting in an accidental tearing or other complications with sexual experiences. Conversely, extremely thin jewelry can cause the same tearing in what is commonly referred to as the ""cheese cutter effect"", either during sudden torsion or over a long period of wearing, especially if the thin jewelry bears any weight.

Prince Albert piercings are typically pierced at either 12 or 10g (2 or 2.5mm). They are often (gradually) stretched soon after, with jewelry within the 8g to 2g (3mm to 6.5mm) range being the most popular. One",497,11, of the reasons not to perform the initial piercing at a

This was supposed to be the first of my post-MW2013 posts, wrapping up the conference and starting to pull together the underlying themes and ideas that emerged for me during the week in Portland. And then I arrived in Texas, and Google brought me God in the form of a thousand search results; an unexpected kind of creeping normalcy that painted the world a different colour to the way I usually see it. So I thought I’d detour from plan and spend a couple of minutes thinking about some of the immediate questions that this raised for me.

When I search on almost any issue back in Australia, I don’t get a lot of religion in my results. I don’t know whether it’s because we are a largely secular country, or because the profile of people whom otherwise “look” like me to Google (ie, using a Mac, female) in Australia aren’t very religious. Therefore, to look into the Google mirror and find the results reflected back at me so distorted from their usual bent, and from my sense of self, was somewhat jarring. In The Filter Bubble Eli Pariser comments that “from within the bubble, it’s nearly impossible to see how biased it is.” (10) What I think I’ve experienced here in Texas is my first real opportunity to look at the search results presented to me from beyond my normal cocooned perspective. The sensation grates.

I am not even close to making sense of what these kinds of distorting lenses mean for us in museums, but here are some first thoughts. We are all now at the mercy of these kinds of algorithms, because they are in some ways a necessary strategy for coping with the scale of non-hierarchical online information; whether we work in museums or not.

===================

In the marine environment, the [d]{.smallcaps}-amino acids synthesized by microbes can be released into the seawater ([@B1]). [d]{.smallcaps}-Amino acids ([d]{.smallcaps}-AAs), as the α-carbon enantiomers of [l]{.smallcaps}-amino acids ([l]{.smallcaps}-AAs), are commonly known as nonproteinogenic amino acids ([@B2]), and there are few reports about marine bacteria utilizing [d]{.smallcaps}-amino acids as carbon and nitrogen sources ([@B3]). A bacterial strain, JL2886, was isolated from deep seawater at 2,000-m depth of South China Sea collected during a cruise organized by the National Natural Science Foundation of China in August 2012. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain JL2886 belongs to the genus *Phaeobacter*, *Roseobacter* clade ([@B4]). JL2886 can utilize many [d]{.smallcaps}-AAs as a sole source of carbon or nitrogen for growth (our unpublished data).

The complete genome sequencing of strain JL2886 was performed using the PacBio RS platform (Pacific Biosciences). A 10-kb library was sequenced using P4-C2 chemistry on two single-molecule real-time (SMRT) cells. The average read length was 6,734 bp, with a sequencing depth of 289×. The continuous long reads (CLR) were assembled *de novo* using SMRT Analysis version 2.1 and the protocol PacBio Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP) ([@B5]). The consensus polishing process resulted in a highly accurate self-overlapping contig, as observed using Gepard dotplot ([@B6]), with a length of 4,061,725 bp, in addition to five self-overlapping 678,758-bp plasmids, and the overall G+C content of strain JL2886 was 61.52%. DNA methylation was determined using the RS Modification and Motif Analysis protocol within the SMRT Portal version 1.3.3.

Start Two: vs. Houston, Texans were 5-9 and way out of the playoff picture. Houston also had the league's 30th ranked yardage defense last year. Big stat game for Tebow against a lame duck defense playing a late season game at altitude. The bulk of the ""Tebow's stats are better than you'd think"" stuff that you hear on TV is largely a result of big numbers vs. a bad, lame duck defense at altitude.

Start Three: vs. San Diego, the week after San Diego had been eliminated from the playoff picture, also played at altitude.

Start Four: at Miami, rallying very late to forge a regulation tie with an 0-5 opponent that was starting a backup QB.

Tr. 292. Because Dr. Rendleman found nothing physical that would cause plaintiff to need to use the bathroom as frequently as she suggests, his assessment of plaintiff's need for accommodations was based on her subjective reports.
A physician's work restrictions based on a claimant's subjective statements about symptoms are reasonably discounted when the ALJ finds the claimant less than credible. Bray v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 554 F.3d 1219, 1228 (9th Cir.2009). Here, the ALJ found that plaintiff exhibited gain-seeking behavior. Tr. 67. Plaintiff has been attempting to get disability benefits and Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave since 1994. Tr. 521-30. Disability benefits have consistently been denied. Tr. 531-4.
In addition, in approximately 2001, plaintiff began requesting FMLA work-release forms. Plaintiff's treating physician at the time, Dr. Vinson, stated that he was concerned with plaintiff's open ended request for medical leave, stating that plaintiff had frequently expressed a dislike for work in general and he worried that leave would open the door to permanent disability. Tr. 67, 450. Dr. Vinson further opined that, ""I do not feel that her chronic medical condition are [sic] in any way incapacitating or that taking medications would necessarily prevent her from fulfilling her work duties.""

These doctors all refused to sign extended work-release forms because all believed that plaintiff's medical conditions did not impair her ability *982 to work. Based on this evidence, the ALJ concluded that plaintiff ""simply appears to be focused on obtaining disability benefits as a means of avoiding a return to work."" Tr. 67. Accordingly, the ALJ rejected Dr. Rendleman's opinion based on plaintiff's lack of credibility and inconsistencies in the report concerning the effect of plaintiffs impairment.
I find ample evidence in the record supporting the finding that plaintiff is not credible. I also find that Dr. Rendleman's report is not internally consistent. Further, Dr. Rendleman's opinion, even if accepted as true, does not support findings of greater functional limitations than those already addressed by the ALJ. Therefore, as to plaintiff's claims regarding Dr. Rowan-Kelly and Dr. Rendleman, I find that the ALJ adequately considered and properly rejected or accepted all relevant medical evidence.

The PyPy Road Show (1): New York and IBM

We're slowly getting adjusted to the jet-lag (except maybe Samuele). Time to blog...

The past two days at IBM, in New York, have been quite interesting. The place is a research center. Feels University-like, but meetings rooms have no windows and climatization fixed on ""polar"" settings. The building is of course heated at this time of the year, and then the meeting rooms are climatized... I guess that just doesn't make sense to me.

We gave a 1h30 talk to a general audience first. Then we had a compact schedule of meetings with various people or groups of people. In the early preparations for this trip we planned to stay only one day, but Martin Hirzel, our host, found too many people that wanted to talk with us :-)

I think that both us and most of the people we talked with got interesting things out of the meetings. On our side, let me point a few highlights.

We asked two people that worked on the GCs for the Jikes RVM if reusing them for RPython programs would make sense. They didn't scream ""you're mad!"", so I guess the answer is yes. Apparently, it has been done before, too. I'm still not sure I got this right, but it seems that Microsoft paid someone money to integrate them with Rotor... Then the real-time garbage-collection guys explained to us the things that we need to take care about when writing a VM: real-time GC needs not only write barriers and read barriers, but pointer-equality-comparison barriers... They have bad memories of trying to add a posteriori this kind of barrier into existing VMs, so it took us a bit of explaining to make them realize that adding new kinds of barriers is mostly trivial for us (I'm still not 100% sure they got it... bad memories can stick hard).

Then we had discussions with JIT people. Mostly, this allowed us to confirm that Samuele has already got a good idea about what Java JITs like Hotspot can do, and in which kind of situation they work well. As expected, the most difficult bit for a PyPy-like JIT that would run on top of a JVM would be the promotion. We discussed approaches like first generating fall-back cases that include some instrumentation logic, and regenerating code with a few promoted values after some time if it seems like it will be a gain. Replacing a method with a new version is difficult to do in a way that is portable across Java VMs. There are still possible workarounds, but it also means that if we really want to explore this seriously, we should consider experimenting with specifics VMs - e.g. the Jikes RVM gives (or could be adapted to give) hooks to replace methods with new versions of them, which is something that the JVM's own JIT internally does all the time.

We showed the taint object space and the sandboxed PyPy to several groups of security people. I won't say much about it here, beyond the fact that they were generally interested by the fact that the",678,11, corresponding code is very short and easy to play with.
497,0,20105,1025," polymer modification has been achieved by grafting ionic side chains onto a water soluble base polymer, along with hydrophobic side chains. The grafting of sulfoalkyl groups along with alkyl groups has been described. The sulfoalkyl group may be added by reaction of a water soluble polymer containing pendant hydroxyl groups with, for example, 3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propane sulfonate, sodium 3-bromopropane sulfonate or sodium vinylsulfonate and the like. For synthetic polymers, the hydrophobic-hydrophilic polymer can be formed by the copolymerization of suitable monomers, at least one of which provides ionic character for the resulting polymer and at least one of which provides hydrophobic character for the resulting polymer. An example of such a co-polymerization is the reaction of an acrylamide with an alkyl methacrylate, forming a poly(co-acrylamide-alkylmethacrylate). Although ionic polymers, or ionically modified polymers, can increase solubility in water, such ionic character can also increase incompatibility with other water soluble species, such as divalent, trivalent or polyvalent ions. This can result in a reduced efficacy, or ultimately precipitation from solution, of the modified associative polymer.
Viscoelastic surfactants are another class of associative materials that have been taught. The viscoelastic surfactant molecules, when present at a sufficiently high concentration, aggregate into micelles, which may take the form of rods or worm-like micelles, resulting in an associative structure that provides an increase in viscosity. Many surfactants may be used to form viscoelastic solutions, for example, N-erucyl-N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methyl ammonium chloride is a commercially available viscoelastic surfactant. The ionic strength of the solution of viscoelastic surfactants is selected so as to improve viscosity generation. For low salinity water, this generally requires the addition of one or more mono-valent halides or salts of organic anions, with the cation being selected from sodium, potassium or ammonium or the like. Even with an adjusted ionic strength, a high concentration surfactant solution is still required in order to provide a significant increase in viscosity. A surfactant concentration in excess of 5% by weight is not uncommon, and even at this concentration the viscosity of systems at elevated temperature is somewhat limiting. The high surfactant concentration also makes viscoelastic surfactant systems commercially unattractive for many applications. The ionic character of the viscoelastic surfactant can also increase incompatibility with other water soluble species, such as divalent, trivalent or polyvalent ions. This can result in a reduced efficacy of the viscoelastic surfactant system.
The use of a viscoelastic surfactant has been combined with a water soluble polymer modified with hydrophobic side chains. The pendant hydrophobic chains interact with the surfactant micelles creating a viscoelastic gel structure. This association occurs below the typical concentration used for pure visco-elastic surfactant systems, thus providing the potential for more commercially viable applications of visco-elastic surfactants. The solubility of the alkyl modified water soluble polymer limits the size and number of hydrophobic chains that may be incorporated into the polymer. Due to the ionic nature of the surfactant incorporated into the system, incompatibility with other water soluble species, such as divalent, trivalent or polyvalent ions can occur. This can result in a reduced efficacy of the system.
Gelation or",809,11, associative thickening can also be achieved with water soluble

Application for Permission to Appeal Denied by Supreme Court August 20, 1984.
NEARN, Presiding Judge, Western Section.
This is a child custody dispute. The Trial Judge changed custody from the mother to the father and the mother appeals.
We first note that appellant's brief does not comply with Rule 27 T.R.A.P. The brief does not contain a statement of the issues presented for review as required by the Rule. Instead, under the heading of Argument there are posed general questions such as ""Were the factors the Judge considered in his decision for a change of custody proper?"" followed by an argument in favor of an affirmative response to the query. To answer such a query requires a degree of clairvoyance with which this Court is not possessed.
The only issue presented by this appeal and the only one we consider is whether the evidence supports the ruling of the Trial Judge that it was in the best interest of the minor child that custody be for now changed.
The minor child is a boy, approximately three years of age. In the divorce proceedings custody was awarded the mother, with visitation rights in the father. The parents have squabbled over the exercise of those rights since the divorce. Various proceedings, including those for contempt, have been filed or are pending. However, the proceeding now appealed from is the hearing on the father's petition for change of custody and we will confine this opinion to matters that bear on that issue, although the proof is liberally sprinkled, if not saturated, with evidence on other issues.
Sometime after the mother was awarded custody of the child, she moved to the state of Louisiana with a male friend to whom she is now married and living with in that state. The order of custody did not forbid the mother to leave the state, but did order her to notify the father if she did leave. She failed to notify the father and secreted herself and the child in Louisiana for several months. With the aid of detectives, the father located the child and by means of a writ of habeas corpus obtained physical custody of the child and returned to this state where the petition to change custody had been filed and where the mother appeared and defended the petition.
The proof shows that the mother loves her child, properly cares for his physical needs and is a good mother.
The husband did not attempt to show that she was a ""bad"" mother. However, the proof does show that while the father has not been in the past an exemplary citizen and probably in the past has not exercised the care and concern for the child that he should have, he has now or is now attempting to change his ways and accept his parental responsibilities.
The major factor relied upon by the father to show a change in circumstance is the home environment of the child in the state of Louisiana; specifically, the character of the mother",703,11,'s new husband. The mother testified that the stepfather

Fiber Optic Star Ceiling Panel With Day Time Stars

I wanted to create a star ceiling, but since we are currently renting, I didn't want to drill into the actual ceiling. So here's how to create a portable star ceiling you can take with you. The total cost of this project is around USD $100

Step 1: Purchase Fiber Optic Driver and Cable

I purchased this 150 light set off of ebay for around $60. This one came with a remote control and 16 colors to choose from. In addition, it's low profile driver will be perfect to fit in the frame.

Step 2: Purchase a Poster Board

I wanted something that was going to be sturdy enough to drill holes through, hold all the cables behind it, and look stylish. I came across this at Target for around $25.

Step 3: Remove the Cardboard Poster Backing

I removed the plastic cover from the poster to leave just the cardboard frame.

Step 4: Paint It Black

Next I grabbed some MATTE black spray paint and gave a good solid coating over the back of the poster board

Step 5: (Optional) Day Time Stars

I didn't want my star ceiling to look like a solid black tile during the daytime, so using some white GLOSS spray paint I added some daytime stars. To do this, simply press down very gently on the top nozzle of the spray paint, till it sputters. It should look like it spitting. Then quickly aim it at your black background. It should only take a few spits to create the desired look

Step 6: Place the Backboard in the Frame

Step 7: Drill Holes for Starfeild

I highly recommend you drill holes where the daytime stars appear. This is because they will already have a very nice distribution across the entire surface of the board. I tried to make my own pattern instead and in looks very contrived instead of natural looking.

Step 8: Light Shining Through

Make sure all of your holes are clean and you patch up any unsightly looking spots on the front.

Step 9: Set Your Fiber Optic Driver Foundation

Place your fiber optic driver in a place off to the side of the frame. Then secure with zip ties.

Step 10: Place Fiber Optic Lights Through Pre-drilled Holes

Grabbing groups of lights at a time, start running the cables through your holes. You'll want to keep these group somewhat organized, so I used more zip-ties. The group simply helps you lay the cables flat as you prepare to mount to ceiling. Don't worry about the cables peaking through the front, we'll trim those back later.

Step 11: Glue It Good

Once you've got all of your cables placed in the holes, you can start gluing to keep them in place. I used Elmers Clear Glue liberally on every singly hole.

Step 12: Allow 12 Hours for Glue to Dry

Step 13: Trim Back the Ends

After the glue has dried, you'll have a lot of cables sticking through the front. I used fingernail clippers to trim these flush with the board.

Step 14: Mount It

That's pretty much it for building the star panel. Now you can mount the panel in way you light and enjoy your new star field!",717,11,"

The Ferdnance and Kemppainen grievances were heard at the next Joint Committee meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. Plaintiff Kemppainen was present and spoke on his behalf. Although plaintiff Ferdnance was notified of the Atlanta hearing, he failed to appear and did not notify Local 299 that he would not attend. Holsinger again spoke on behalf of both plaintiffs, raising arguments similar to those he had presented before the Tri-City Panel. The Joint Committee found the conduct of Ferdnance and Kemppainen to be in violation of the no-strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement, and sustained both discharges. All plaintiffs then filed the complaint in the case presently before the Court.
Plaintiffs concede that the basic facts are not disputed. They contend, however, that there is a genuine factual issue as to the purpose of the strike, and that that issue precludes a grant of summary judgment in this case. Plaintiffs argue that if the strike were directed at the Union rather than ATI, as plaintiffs contend, it did not concern an arbitrable grievance and therefore was not in violation of the collective bargaining agreement. Under this theory, therefore, plaintiffs' discharges were not ""for just cause"" as required by the agreement.
Clearly, the Court cannot grant a motion for summary judgment if there exists a genuine issue of material fact. See Rule 56, Fed.Rules Civ.Pro.; Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962). This principle applies, however, only when the factual issue is material; if the only factual disputes concern issues which are unnecessary to disposition of the case, summary judgment may be appropriate. 6 Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 56.15[1.-0] (2d ed. 1976 & Supp. 1977-78).
Even assuming that there is a genuine dispute as to the purpose of the strike,[1] the Court is of the opinion that such a factual dispute is immaterial to disposition of the instant case. The Joint Committee has determined that plaintiffs' conduct violated the collective bargaining agreement, and constituted just cause for the dismissals; whether or not this Court agrees with that determination, it is bound to accept it under a long line of court precedent. See, e. g., General Drivers v. Riss, 372 U.S. 517, 83 S.Ct. 789, 9 L.Ed.2d 918 (1963); United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593,",536,11," 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L."

News broke this week that David Bowie refused the offer to work with Dave Grohl, making him one of the few musicians ever not to have collaborated with the Foo Fighters’ leader. To be fair, nothing has emerged featuring Grohl performing with Father Abraham and the Smurfs, either, though we’ve heard rumours there’s a bootleg on the internet of the Foos performing The Smurf Song with Father Abraham at the Amsterdam Paradiso, but without any actual smurfs on stage. Grohl approached Bowie two years ago, asking him to sing on a piece of music for a film. Bowie’s response: “David, I watched the movie and I got to be honest, it’s not my thing … I’m not made for these times. So thanks, but I think I’m gonna sit this one out.” Grohl replied, and received a response from Bowie: “Alright, well that’s settled, then. Now fuck off.” Perhaps Bowie was worried that him plus a hard rock guitarist might have resulted in Tin Machine 3.

(Since publication of this article, many of you have alerted me to the fact that Grohl and Bowie did in fact work together on Heathen and at Bowie’s 50th birthday concert. I am going to listen to The Smurf Song on repeat all weekend as penance. Apologies.)

The Al-Khalid (—,  literally ""The Eternal Tank"") is a main battle tank jointly developed by Pakistan and China during the 1990s, based on the Chinese Type 90-IIM tank. The original prototype was developed by China North Industries Corporation (Norinco) under the name MBT-2000, and Norinco also offered the tank for export.  Around 310 Al Khalid MBTs had been produced by 2014. The Bangladesh Army ordered 44 MBT-2000s from China in 2011. The Norinco-made MBT-2000 is also used by the Royal Moroccan Army. It was trialled by the Peruvian Army for possible acquisition, but was not purchased due to financial problems.

Operated by a crew of three and armed with a 125 mm smooth-bore tank gun that is reloaded automatically, the tank uses a fire-control system and night-fighting equipment. Al-Khalid is named after the 7th-century Muslim commander Khalid bin al-Walid (592–642 AD).

The current production variant of the Al-Khalid uses a diesel engine and transmission supplied by the KMDB design bureau of Ukraine. The first production models entered service with the Pakistan Army in 2001. The country placed an order with Ukraine to further upgrade the tanks with a new engine.

Development
In the 1970s, the leaders of China's People's Liberation Army were concerned about the Soviet threat, and requested an improved main battle tank (MBT) to replace the old and obsolete Type 59 tank. Thus in 1980, Norinco was formed, and the Inner Mongolia First Machine Group Corporation was tasked with developing a series of new tanks.

A joint development deal was signed with Pakistan in January 1990. Initial Chinese-built prototypes were tested in Pakistan in August 1991. Pakistan completed its manufacturing plant at Taxila in 1992. Pakistan spent more than USD $20 million over the next eight years on the co-development of a model suitable for its needs and on creating a capability to manufacture it locally. The Director General of Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT) Lt Gen Hamid Javaid and Major General Muhammad Asad supervised the project. The design team modified the tank to accept a foreign-built engine. Several different prototypes were evaluated.

In light of high ambient temperatures and the fine sand or dust that would be encountered in operational areas such as the deserts of southern Pakistan, the development of high performance cooling and air filtering systems was emphasized during the planning stage of the project. Implementation of a hydro-gas suspension system was considered but, after technical evaluation, it was found to be impractical due to various limitations such as problems with reliability and maintainability. Installation of the Renk 304 transmission was also considered but discarded.

An early version was armed with a Chinese gun and fire-control system, and had a German-designed MTU-396 diesel engine which was built under licence in China. Another version was equipped with a more advanced Western digital fire-control system and powered by a Perkins  Condor diesel engine (as in the British Challenger) and SESM ESM500 automatic transmission (as in the French Leclerc). This version was considered too expensive, and under-performed in the extreme heat of southern Pakistan. Finally, a version was tested with the compact Ukrainian 6TD-2 1,200 hp diesel engine. This configuration was chosen by Pakistan for the production version of the tank and came to be known as Al-Khalid. Ukraine also sold T-80UD tanks to Pakistan, which were powered by a similar engine.

The final tank design resulting from a decade of co-operative development was designated Type 90-IIM. The Chinese company Norinco showed the new Type 90-IIM during the March 2001 Abu Dhabi Defense Expo, under the export name MBT 2000. The version powered by the Ukrainian engine, intended for domestic production in Pakistan, was named Al-Khalid.

During the development period, Heavy Industries Taxila gained experience after building the Type 85-IIAP under Chinese licence and prepared to begin production of the Al-Khalid tank in 1999. A pilot batch of fifteen tanks was inducted into the 31st Cavalry Regiment of Pakistan's Armoured Corps on 20 July 2001. Pakistan signed a contract with Ukraine's Malyshev Factory in May 2002 for the delivery of 315 KMDB 6TD-2 diesel engines over three years.

507,0,21741,0,"Jerusalem (CNN) Energized by American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the country's right-wing government has accelerated plans that imperil a two-state solution, solidifying Israel's power and control over Jerusalem.

In an all-night session, the Knesset, Israel's parliament, enacted a law early Tuesday making it much more difficult to negotiate Jerusalem as part of a peace process. The holy city is the most sensitive -- and perhaps most important -- issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with parts of the city claimed by both sides as their capital.

Only days earlier, a guiding body for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party voted unanimously to apply Israeli law to West Bank settlements. Although that vote was non-binding, such a move would be seen as Israeli annexation of the territory.

The law was passed as an amendment to Israel's Basic Law -- the closest thing Israel has to a constitution -- which gives it more political weight. The amendment stipulates that any attempt to transfer sovereign control of Jerusalem to a foreign entity needs to be approved by a supermajority of 80 Knesset members out of 120.

Previously, the requirement was a majority of 61 members.

And, in a move that is surely to be met with Palestinian outrage, the amendment also authorizes the Knesset to change the municipal borders of Jerusalem with a simple majority, provided any neighborhoods removed from the city remain under Israeli sovereignty. That allows Israel to remove Palestinian neighborhoods from the city per the Greater Jerusalem Plan being advanced by members of Netanyahu's governing coalition.

""The goal is one that is shared by the overwhelming majority of Jewish Israelis,"" Deputy Minister Michael Oren told CNN,"" that Jerusalem will remain our capital and a Jewish majority city.""

In response to the new law, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said it was a ""declaration of war"" against the Palestinian people and their identity.

""This vote clearly indicates that Israel has officially declared the end of the so-called political process and has already begun to impose dictating and de facto policies,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.

""There is no legitimacy to the Trump decision, and there is no legitimacy to all the decisions of the Israeli Knesset. We will not allow in any way to allow such plans that are dangerous for the future of the region and the world to pass.""

Advancing the plan would also fuel unrest in a city and a region that has seen regular demonstrations since Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in early December.

The new law has little practical effect, says Daniel Siedemann, director of Terrestrial Jerusalem, a left-wing NGO that tracks developments in the holy city, but ""it does however incrementally add to the despair on the Palestinian side in the absence of any prospect of forward movement [toward a final-status agreement].""

""This is an unabashed attempt to shackle future Israeli majorities, and it fits into a whole range of actions that are currently taking place that are geared to make any future permanent status agreement based on the two-state solution impossible. This is a strategic thrust in that direction.""

Praising the amendment's passage, Education Minister Naftali Bennett said, ""Our understanding is clear: No Jew has the authority to give up any part of the land. Nor does the Jewish people.""

Though the amendment requires 80 votes to cede any part of Jerusalem, the amendment itself can be cancelled or changed with only 61 votes. Effectively, that means any governing coalition can alter the law, since 61 is the minimum number of seats for a coalition.

Slamming Bennett and pointing out the relative ease of changing the law, Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog said in a statement, ""Laws which do not benefit the citizens at all are being advanced only because of one person who is leading the coalition: Naft",817,11,"ali Bennett.""

How can a pendulum have amplitude greater than $\pi$?

How can a pendulum have amplitude angle greater than $\pi$? I've been reading about phase plots, which are graphs of the $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ on the $y$ axis and $\theta$ on the $x$ axis, shown below.

I can understand that the curves are not perfect ovals because we cannot use the small angle approximation. I can also see that there is one curve in the right side's drawing which looks like a sine curve shape, but intersects the $x$ axis at $\pi$ and $-\pi$.
But how are the other curves i.e. the curve intersecting $y$ axis at +2 created? What equation gives that and how would the pendulum's motion look? How would such an equation be derived?
I have a pendulum equation $$\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2g}{l}(1-cos\theta_A)}$$
($\theta_A$ is amplitude)
I derived that with conservation of energy laws, like for a simple pendulum but I did not do the small angle approximation. I tried to put $\theta_A=\pi+1$ and I got a simple oval, not the pair of curves that is symmetric about the $x$ axis. I do not understand the math and notation being used in this question: What is the period of a physical pendulum without using small-angle approximation?
I'm confused.

A:

How are the other curves i.e. the curve intersecting y axis at +2 created?

The trick behind understanding that phase portrait is realizing that the 'amplitude' is not the fundamental quantity which acts as the difference between those lines.
The amplitude of a pendulum is usually considered to be the angle or displacement at which the velocity is zero, according to conventional intuition. But we see that the line you pointed out, the one with a maximum angular velocity of $2$, never reaches $\frac{d\theta}{dt}=0$, so a 'pendulum'described by that line",474,11, won't have an amplitude according to our usual definition.
511,0,21556,0,"Sinopia

Sinopia (also known as sinoper, named after the now Turkish city Sinop) is a dark reddish-brown natural  earth pigment, whose reddish colour comes from hematite, a dehydrated form of iron oxide. It was widely used in Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages for painting, and during the Renaissance it was often used on the rough initial layer of plaster for the underdrawing for a fresco. The word came to be used both for the pigment and for the preparatory drawing itself, which may be revealed when a fresco is stripped from its wall for transfer. 

During the Middle Ages sinopia in Latin and Italian came to mean simply a red ochre. It entered the English language as the word sinoper, meaning a red earth colour.

Sinopia is a colour in various modern colour systems.

Sinopia pigment

From Ancient times through the Renaissance, the pigment was mined in Cappadocia, and exported to Europe through the port of Sinop, a Greek colony on the Black Sea. The pigment was valued for its quality and the genuine product was marked with a seal to show its authenticity. 
 
In the Renaissance ""sinopia"" or ""sinoper"" meant any of a range of different shades and hues, and the colour had a variety of names;  it was sometimes called Venetian red,  or Terra di Siena (Sienna earth), or Ocra rosso (red ochre). The colour shown in the box above is one more recent commercial variety of the colour.

The Italian painter and writer Cennino Cennini (c. 1370- c. 1440) described sinopia in his handbook on painting, ""Il libro dell'arte"", this way: ""A natural pigment called sinoper, cinabrese or porphyry is red. This pigment has a lean and dry character. It responds well to milling, as the more it is pulvarised  the finer it becomes. It is good for working on panel or on anconas [a type of panel divided into smaller framed compartments], or walls, in fresco and in secco.""

Cinabrese and flesh tones
Cennino Cennini described a light red colour he called cinabrese, which was apparently a mixture of a light shade of sinopia and lime white;  ""And I do not know"", Cennini wrote, ""that they use this pigment outside Florence. And it is absolutely perfect for doing flesh or for making flesh colours for figures on walls. And work in fresco with it. This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John's white, as  it is called in Florence; and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime...this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls...""

Sinopia as preparatory drawing of frescoes
Sinopia was often used in the Renaissance to make the preparatory drawing for frescoes directly onto the wall, on the levelling coat or on the arriccio. These drawings became known simply as sinopie, the plural word in Italian for the pigment. Many of these drawings have been discovered and restored, and are on display in the Museum of Sinopie (Museo delle Sinopie) in Pisa, next to the cathedral, baptistry and the leaning tower.

512,0,28220,3075," to be convicted in 2011. 1 Further, defendant argued that he was not

notified that his registration period was extended and it was an unconstitutional extension.

Additionally, he argued that his requirement to register beyond the initial 10-year term without

any means to petition for removal was unconstitutional; he should be given an individual

assessment to determine whether he posed a continuing risk to the public; and the continued

registration requirement is a legislative loophole.               These failures, as applied to defendant,

violated his due process rights and the proportionate penalties clause.

¶ 18    The State argued that defendant had sexually abused his 10-year-old daughter in 1998.

Defendant conceded that he failed to register during his first 10-year term and violated SORA,

which he was sentenced on in 2006. Defendant was then informed of his duty to continue to

register.

            This is a reference to a prior conviction for failure to register.

¶ 19   Defendant responded pro se before the court that police were supposed to present him

with a letter to sign if his registration term was extended. The trial court ultimately denied

defendant's pro se motion and noted that defendant did have acts of violence perpetrated since

the date of his original conviction in 1998. Defense counsel then addressed the motion for new

trial, which was also denied.

¶ 20   During sentencing, the State argued that defendant's failure to register was a Class 2

offense and it was extendable. The State recommended a six-year sentence. The defense

countered that defendant's only convictions were older and besides failure to register, he had no

convictions since 2011. In allocution, defendant argued that his failure to register should be a

Class 3 and not a Class 2.

¶ 21   The trial court sentenced defendant to four years' imprisonment. Defendant's motion to

reconsider sentence was denied and this timely appeal followed.

¶ 22                                       ANALYSIS

¶ 23   On appeal, defendant contends that SORA's statutory scheme violates federal and Illinois

due process rights by infringing on registrants' fundamental liberty interests where it places upon

them severe restrictions, intrusive monitoring and burdensome registration requirements without

providing substantive or procedural due process. In support of this assertion, defendant first

contends that the current version of SORA is punitive in nature. Defendant maintains that

The present invention generally relates to a composition for treating hearing loss. More specifically, the present invention relates to a composition for treating hearing loss that includes components that function through different biological mechanisms and provide an additive effect that is greater than the effect of the most effective of the individual components alone, and a method of treating hearing loss including the step of administering the composition to a mammal prior to or within 3 days following trauma to the inner ear.
2. Description of the Related Art
Extensive studies have been performed on compositions for treating hearing loss, along with methods of treating hearing loss using various compositions. In particular, antioxidants, among numerous other components, have been found to play a role in the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. Specific antioxidants shown to be partially effective in reducing noise-induced hearing loss in animal models include glutathione (GSH)/glutathione monoethyl ester, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), resveratrol, allopurinol, R-phenylisopropyladenosine, salicylates, and vitamins A, C, and E. Otoprotective effects of the above individual dietary antioxidants are well known in the art.
To date, little, if any, additive effects have been found to exist by combining many of the known components for treating hearing loss. Additive effects, as used herein, refer to effects that are greater than the most effective of the individual components alone. For the most part, no greater effect is observed by combining many of the different components that are effective in treating hearing loss than the effect of the most effective individual component in the composition, i.e., combinations of agents are only as effective as the most effective single agent delivered alone. For example, FIG. 1 shows the results of experimentation relative to additive effects of Trolox®, which is a water-soluble analogue of alpha-tocopheral (vitamin E), in combination with vitamins A and C, as compared to the effects of Trolox® alone. The experimental conditions are described in further detail in the Examples section below. As is evident from FIG. 1, the combined effect of Trolox® and vitamins A and C in minimizing threshold shift, i.e., hearing loss, is no greater than the effect of Trolox® alone. As such, the combination of Trolox® and vitamins A and C does not produce an additive effect in treating hearing loss.
As the understanding of the mechanisms by which the various antioxidants work to treat or prevent hearing loss has become clearer, it has been found that combinations of certain antioxidants that act via complementary, but different, biochemical mechanisms may be more effective than the individual antioxidants alone. However, given the volume and variety of components that are known to affect hearing loss, as well as lack of knowledge relative to specific mechanisms by which the components function, additive effects between components have not been recognized to date. Further, significant treatments for preventing hearing loss, specifically noise-induced hearing loss, using a post-trauma treatment paradigm have yet to be achieved. There has been a long-felt need for such a treatment, since the vast majority of treatments to prevent noise-induced hearing loss are needed post-trauma.
In spite of the fact that additive effects between various components have not been recognized to date, certain disclosures have been made that generally group together many components for treating hearing loss. These disclosures do not teach with sufficient specificity combinations of specific components that exhibit additive effects in treating hearing loss or which are effective in post-trauma treatment paradigms. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,093,417 is directed to a composition to treat ear disorders. The composition is topically applied into an ear canal to treat the hearing disorder. Although the U.S. Pat. No. 6,093,417 is directed to a composition that may include many components that are known to be somewhat effective in reducing hearing loss alone, including vitamin E and zinc salts, such as zinc salicylate, there is no recognition of an additive effect between any of the components, when applied topically.

However, given the volume and variety of components that are known to affect hearing loss, as well as lack of knowledge relative to specific mechanisms by which the components function, additive effects between components have not been recognized to date. Further, significant treatments for preventing hearing loss, specifically noise-induced hearing loss, using a post-trauma treatment paradigm have yet to be achieved. There has been a long-felt need for such a treatment, since the vast majority of treatments to prevent noise-induced hearing loss are needed post-trauma.
In spite of the fact that additive effects between various components have not been recognized to date, certain disclosures have been made that generally group together many components for treating hearing loss.",702,11, These disclosures do not teach with sufficient specificity combinations of specific

GraphQL: Creating and Returning an Object in a Resolver?

I've got a mutation resolver that I call directly from the server like this:

import AllResolvers from ""../../resolvers"";
import AllSchema from ""../../schema"";
import {makeExecutableSchema} from ""graphql-tools"";

const typeDefs = [AllSchema];
const resolvers = [AllResolvers];

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers
});

const {data, errors} = await graphql(
    schema,

    {timeStarted: new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 19).replace('T','')}
)

The mutation resolver is called and runs correctly. I don't need it to return anything, but GraphQL throws a warning if it doesn't, so I'd like it to return an object, any object. 
So I'm trying it like this:

In particular cases, several authors managed to obtain further results, to name but a few, see Hu and Schweizer [@hu], Hu, Imkeller and Müller [@him], Mania and Tevzadze [@man] or Delbaen, et al.

His methodology is fundamentally different, since he uses a fixed-point argument to obtain existence of a solution for small terminal condition, and then pastes solutions together in the general bounded case. In this regard, there is no longer any need to obtain the difficult strong convergence result needed by Kobylanski [@kob]. More recently, applying yet a completely different approach using now a forward point of view and stability results for a special class of quadratic semimartingales, Barrieu and El Karoui [@elkarbar] generalized the above results. Their approach has the merit of greatly simplifying the problem of strong convergence of the martingale part when using approximation arguments, since they rely on very general semimartingale convergence results.

What thickness/depth of water would be required to provide radiation shielding in Earth orbit?

If using water or ice as a radiation shield how thick/deep would it need to be?  Would it make a difference if the water was frozen (water ice being less dense then liquid)?
Edit
I would like to know how much shielding would be required for an indefinite stay. Preferably at Terrestrial limits per Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR 1910.96), but at least at levels per National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) presented in its Report 98 A beginning place for research is the Spaceflight Radiation Health Program at JSC  A listing of all different types of radiation NASA ""What is space radiation?""

A:

We know from the nuclear power industry that spent fuel storage pools are pretty safe places to be around, radiation-wise. They're actually safe to swim in, to a point, because they're serviced routinely by human divers. They just can't get too close to the spent fuel.
We use these pools for short-term storage because water is a really good radiation shield. How good? Well, according to a report on the topic prepared for the DoE back in 1977, a layer of water 7 centimeters thick reduces the ionizing radiation (rays and particles) transmitted through it by half (the remainder is captured or moderated to non-ionizing energy levels, mainly heat). Freshly discharged nuclear fuel puts out about 100,000 R/hour as measured from one foot away in air (at that rate, certain death is about 5 minutes' exposure and you'd fall into a coma in about 10). Background ionizing radiation levels on Earth's surface are about.000001 R/hour (1 mSv/hr), while a ""safe dose"" to live with long-term is about.0004 R/hr. A halving represents about.3 of a power of 10, so in rough terms, to reduce a fresh fuel rod's radioactivity to safe levels, you would need about 2 meters (8/0.3 * 7 / 100), and through more than 2.5m the radioactivity of the fuel rods is indistinguishable from background radiation. In fact, according to the link from the comment, diving about 6 feet down would expose you to less radiation than at the surface of the pool.
According to Wikipedia, the upper estimate for a dose equivalent received by unshielded astronauts operating outside Earth's magnetic field (such as a mission to Mars) is about 90,000 R/yr or about 10 R/hour. If we assume the energy levels are comparable, reducing that to lower than Earth background radiation would only require a layer of water around 1 meter thick.
However, let's do some more math. Let's say that the Mars vehicle that will get them there and back is a cylinder roughly 3.5m by 20m (same as was used for the MARS-500 experiments; that is a very small tin can in which to spend 3 1/2 years with 4 or 5 other people). With 1m of shielding water around all surfaces of that cylinder, the outer hull would be about 5.5m by 22m. 
The volume of shielding water needed is the difference between those two cylinders, or $22\cdot\pi\cdot2.75^2 - 20\cdot\pi\cdot1.75^2 \approx 522.68 - 192.42 = 330.26 m^3$. As one cubic meter of water weighs 1 metric ton (1,000kg), that's 330,260kg to get into space.
Putting that in perspective, the current record holder for payload-to-LEO is the Saturn V rocket, which had a maximum LEO payload of 120,000kg (said payload being the S-IVb, including CSM, LEM and Earth departure stage, for most of its missions). To put the volume of water we'd need into orbit would require 3 Saturn V rockets. The planned-but-never-built Ares V was spec'ed to have 188 tonnes P2LEO capacity, which would have cut down the number of launches to only 2. Doing it with Space Shuttles (25 tonnes cargo to LEO) would take 14 missions. The SLS Block II (130 tonnes payload to LEO) would take just about 3 launches. Doing it with any orbital rocket currently in service, manned or unmanned (Soyuz II,",933,11," Soyuz FG, Delta IV, Atlas V, Falcon"

1
This is an action to recover an alleged overpayment of income taxes and interest for the years 1955 and 1956 in the amount of $274,562.75. The parties by joint stipulation have agreed that four of the six separate counts included in the petition, namely counts 2, 3, 4 and 6, are to be dismissed with prejudice. These cross-motions for summary judgment pertain to the remaining counts — counts 1 and 5.


2
The issue before the court is whether plaintiff had a sufficient economic interest in natural gas in place to entitle it to participate in the depletion allowance for income tax purposes. This court in CBN Corporation v. United States, 328 F.2d 316, 164 Ct.Cl. 540 (1964) held that plaintiff, who before 1952 was a buyer of gas from Shamrock Oil Corporation, acquired an economic interest in the gas in place as a result of a 1952 agreement with Shamrock. The 1952 agreement relieved plaintiff of the obligation of buying gas from certain reserves of Shamrock (which gas plaintiff used either to produce carbon black or to sell to others) and instead, gave plaintiff a payment for the gas from the set-aside reserves sold by Shamrock to others. As a result of holding an economic interest, plaintiff was entitled to take the depletion allowance in computing its 1953 taxes. The facts in this case are the same as in the prior CBN case, supra. Only different tax years are involved.1


3
Plaintiff, therefore, maintains that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes defendant from opposing its summary judgment motion on grounds already litigated in the prior opinion. Practically speaking, plaintiff's argument is that, since the facts and legal arguments of the prior CBN case and this case are identical, the court must render judgment for plaintiff.


4
Plaintiff's doctrinaire approach is based on the Supreme Court's approach to collateral estoppel as set forth in Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948). There the Court stated at 597-598, 68 S.Ct. at 719:

* * * where the second action between the same parties is upon a different cause or demand, the principle of res judicata is applied much more narrowly. In this situation, the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel, not as to matters which might have been litigated and determined, but ""only as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered."" * * * But matters which were actually litigated and determined in the first proceeding cannot later be relitigated. Once a party has fought out a matter in litigation with the other party, he cannot later renew that duel. In this sense, res judicata is usually and more accurately referred to as estoppel by judgment, or collateral estoppel. * * It is the above quoted language which plaintiff uses as the foundation of its argument.

526,0,22443,0,"As is known in the art, it is frequently desirable to detect and segment an object from a background of other objects and/or from a background of noise.

In other cases it would be desirable to segment a moving, deformable anatomical feature such as the heart.
In 1988, Osher and Sethian, in a paper entitled “Fronts propagation with curvature dependent speed: Algorithms based on Hamilton-Jacobi formulations” J. of Comp. Phys., 79:12-49, 1988, introduced the level set method, it being noted that a precursor of the level set method was proposed by Dervieux and Thomasset in a paper entitled “A finite element method for the simulation of Raleigh-Taylor instability”. Springer Lect. Notes in Math., 771:145-158, 1979, as a means to implicitly propagate hypersurfaces C(t) in a domain Ω⊂Rn by evolving an appropriate embedding function φ: Ω×[0,T]→R, where:C(t)={xεΩ|φ(x,t)=0}.  (1)
More generally, an embedding function is a real-valued height function \phi(x) defined at each point x of the image plane, such that the contour C corresponds to all points x in the plane where \phi(x)=0:C={x|\phi(x)=0}
This is a way to represent a contour C implicitly. Rather than working with a contour C (moving the contour etc), one works with the function \phi. Moving the values of \phi will implicitly move the “embedded” contour. This is why \phi(x) is called an “embedding function”—it embeds the contour as its zero-level or isoline to value 0.
The ordinary differential equation propagating explicit boundary points is thus replaced by a partial differential equation modeling the evolution of a higher-dimensional embedding function. The key advantages of this approach are well-known: Firstly, the implicit boundary representation does not depend on a specific parameterization, during the propagation no control point regridding mechanisms need to be introduced. Secondly, evolving the embedding function allows to elegantly model topological changes such as splitting and merging of the embedded boundary. In the context of shape modeling and statistical learning of shapes, the latter property allows to construct shape dissimilarity measures defined on the embedding functions which can handle shapes of varying topology. Thirdly, the implicit representation, equation (1), naturally generalizes to hypersurfaces in three or more dimensions. To impose a unique correspondence between a contour and its embedding function one can constrain φ to be a signed distance function, i.e. |∇φ|=1 almost everywhere.
The first applications of the level set method to image segmentation were pioneered in the early 90's by Malladi et al. in a paper entitled “A finite element method for the simulation of Raleigh-Taylor instability: Springer Lect. Notes in Math., 771:145-158, 1979, by Caselles et al. in a paper entitled “Geodesic active contour.” In Proc. IEEE Intl. Conf. on Comp.

The Moller Skycar is a prototype personal VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft – a ""flying car"" – concept invented by Paul Moller who has been attempting to develop such a vehicle type for more than fifty years. As of 2019, no Moller air vehicle has successfully flown in free, non-tethered flight.

The parent company, Moller International, has been dormant since 2015.

Description
The M400 craft, previously under development, is purported to ultimately transport four people; single-seat up to six-seat variations are also planned. It is described as a car since it is aimed at being a popular means of transport for anyone who can drive, incorporating automated flight controls, with the driver only inputting direction and speed required.

After forty years and $100,000,000 in expenditure the Skycar demonstrated tethered hovering capability in 2003.  It has been extensively marketed for pre-order sale since the 1990s as Moller attempted to raise more money for development.

For Fans Of: The Untold Tale

2 OUT OF 5 STARS

“If you wanted to, Safiya, you could bend and shape the world.”

Safiya and Iseult always stick together, but when a heist goes all wrong they end up with a Bloodwitch on their trail. To make matters worse Safiya is a pawn in her Uncle’s plans while Iseult has to deal with being a failure at her witchery. Safiya being a Truthwitch means that everyone is out to get her. The girls struggle to stick together as the tides of war try to tear them apart.

Dennard has created an incredibly complex world for her story, but it’s perhaps a little too confusing. A listing off all the different witch specializations is never provided and readers are just tossed into a complicated political situation in a world with confusing rules. Over-explaining is a huge issue in fantasy, but under-explaining can be just as deadly to a novel. The world exists, but the world-building is lackluster. Dennard tosses around names like readers should already know them and it’s hard to get involved in a novel when you’re struggling to understand what anything means.

The core of the story is a strong friendship between Iseult and Safiya, and I wish we had seen more of it. The book keeps a constant moving pace (despite not much happening) and their development suffers for it. I know more about Iseult’s relationship with her mother and tribe than about her and Safiya.

The romance was entirely unnecessary and took up pages that could have been used to better explain",471,11, the world or better develop the characters. A book with

Detective Emily Fields

The episode begins with Spencer finally coming clean to Aria & Emily that Toby is apart of the ‘A’ team. Aria & Emily initially seem really shocked, and Emily is actually in denial. The three continue to debate how it’s possible and what his motive is, but can’t seem to come to a mutual answer.

Emily, super pressed by this news decides that since she was Toby’s friend, that she wants answers from him herself, so she tries tracking him down by calling and leaving voicemails and texting him. She also decides to visit Toby’s work to see if anyone there has seen him, but one of his colleagues tells her that he said he was going out of town and he hasn’t seen him in a few weeks.

Later on, Emily finally gets a reply text from Toby saying he agrees to meet her, but alone. Emily obviously not having a life, sits and waits in her car for 2 hours and still no sign of Toby. She decides to go inside their meeting place and sees the guy she spoke to earlier from his work. He asks what she’s doing there and she tells him she’s meeting Toby. He calls Emily by her name, but Emily says she never told him her name.

Emily returns to her car to find it broken into, and a note is left saying “Toby is no more – A”. Hmm.

Conveniently, the video is shot at an angle that hides Wilden’s actions (going for his gun). Hanna tells Aria what happened and they decide to get rid of the evidence the best way they know how, by pushing the car into the river. I don’t really think that was the best idea ladies, but let’s see what happens.

Third Wheel

Maggie and Malcolm are staying with Ezra now that his mum has decided to sell the apartment she had them staying in due to her argument with Ezra last episode. Ezra tells Aria that Maggie wants to move to Rosewood and she’s looking at places and looking for a job as this would make things easier if they lived closer to each other.

Aria ends up baby sitting Malcolm while Maggie and Ezra are out. Poor Aria turns her back for a few minutes and Malcolm starts jumping on the bed and falls off and hits his chin. Aria & Ezra take him to the hospital and he gets some stitches. Aria feels really guilty and apologises profusely to Ezra, but he ensures her it’s alright and they both admit that they know nothing about being parents. Aww, how sweet. Maggie should have Parenting 101 classes for them.

537,0,24361,0,"Offit is the chief of the infectious diseases unit at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and has written extensively about the perils of taking the massive doses of vitamins that are routinely sold in health food stores. Part of the problem, he thinks, is that since the vitamin industry is not regulated people remain unaware of the dangers. Offit recently told the Guardian [2]: “Were the FDA to actually regulate this industry, I think megavitamins would have a black box warning on them. But they don’t — the consumer doesn’t know about many of the risks.”

Offit traces the vitamin craze to one of last centuries’ greatest scientists and humanitarian figures: Linus Pauling. Pauling won the Nobel Prize at the age of thirty for redefining the nature of chemical bonds, and followed that up by founding the field of molecular biology and making seminal discoveries in paleontology and evolutionary biology. He went on to win another Nobel, this time the Peace Prize for promoting the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. But then he started promoting excessive amounts of vitamin C as a panacea that could cure everything from the common cold to cancer. He wasn’t a shyster or anything — he himself took 18,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, three hundred times the recommended daily allowance.

Pauling and his followers through the decades attributed vitamins’ miraculous properties to their antioxidant qualities. The process of making energy from food that occurs in the mitochondria within our cells is called oxidation, because oxygen is required in the chemical reaction. Oxidation generates free radicals, molecules that are desperate to react with almost any other molecules they can find. These free radicals, formed as a normal byproduct of normal cellular metabolism, are so highly reactive that they can damage DNA, cell membranes, and the linings of arteries. They have thus been implicated in aging, cancer, and heart disease.

Vitamins — especially vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E, as well as selenium and beta-carotene — are high in antioxidants, which, as their name suggests, neutralize free radicals. The logic thus goes like this: free radicals damage DNA, so they’re bad. Antioxidants fight free radicals, so they’re good. Vitamins have antioxidants, so therefore we should take outrageous amounts of vitamins. This line of reasoning successfully sells not just pills, but foods and face creams as well. You can’t have too much of a good thing, right? And vitamins are “all natural,” so taking more of them can’t hurt, right?

Unfortunately, wrong and wrong. Study after study has shown that ingesting megadoses of vitamins has at least one pretty serious side effect: death. In 1996, one study had to be ended abruptly because subjects who were given vitamin A or beta-carotene were dying of cancer and heart disease at rates 28 and 17 percent higher, respectively, than those who received neither — so it was not ethical to continue giving the vitamins and supplements. Just last year, a Cochrane review concluded that “beta carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A” [3]. Cochrane reviews examine all of the existing primary research on a topic (that meets certain criteria, like being a fair trial) to establish whether or not there is conclusive evidence about a specific treatment. They are internationally recognized as the highest standard in evidence-based",724,11," health care.

Epilogue

I like books. I don’t mean I just like reading books. I mean I like books. It just feels wrong to me to read a book off of a computer screen. I like to turn the pages. I like to feel it in my hands. I like to find some odd piece of scrap paper or some random bookmark to hold my place until I can start reading again. I like to see books sitting on my bookshelf, whether I actually read them or not.

Because of this, I love to randomly cruise bookstores. I hardly ever buy anything. It’s odd. I can watch a movie multiple times and not get tired of it, but once I finish a book, well, I’ve finished it. I don’t pick it up and read it again. Nevertheless, I still like to rummage through bookstores, and occasionally I will actually spend a little money on something to read.

One of my purchases last year was Josh Hamilton’s autobiography Beyond Belief. The book had been out for several years, so I was able to snag it cheap at the local Books-A-M",249,11,illion. Hamilton was still a member of the Texas Rangers

12.17.2014: See more information on the SoakSoak massive malware outbreak resulting from this vulnerability: RevSlider Vulnerability Leads To Massive WordPress SoakSoak Compromise by Daniel Cid



If you need help cleaning a hacked WordPress website, we released a new guide in 2016 that may help:

Guide to Clean Hacked WordPress

Mika Epstein, Ipstenu, of Dreamhost, notified us today of a serious vulnerability in the WordPress Slider Revolution Premium plugin which was patched silently.

It turns out that the vulnerability was disclosed via some underground forums. ThemePunch confirms that their plugin was patched in version 4.2 for those that purchase the plugin directly from them, and they include an auto-updater which would address the problem. The real issue lies in the way the plugin is wrapped into theme packages. ThemePunch’s approach to disclosing the issue was based on guidance they received.

This a very popular plugin, and appears to be one of the most downloaded slider plugins from Envato’s Marketplace – Code Canyon. It also appears to be bundled in theme packages so be sure to check your theme / plugins.

This is an example of where things go terribly wrong.

In this situation, a very popular plugin developer decided it was best not to disclose to anyone, in return patching silently. Mind you, this vulnerability was already disclosed as a zero day via underground forums, which you would have thought would incentivize a developer to work quickly and disclose even faster. No, instead a different course of action was taken.

Now, the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild. Yes, the vulnerability is severe enough that the attackers are able to compromise websites through it.

WordPress Slider Revolution Vulnerability

About 2 months ago someone publicly disclosed a serious vulnerability in the Slider Revolution Premium WordPress Plugin that allows a remote attacker to download any file from the server.

The proof of concept shared via underground sites shows how someone can easily download the wp-config.php:

http://victim.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=revslider_show_image&img=../wp-config.php

This is used to steal the database credentials, which then allows you to compromise the website via the database.

This type of vulnerability is known as a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack. The attacker is able to access, review, download a local file on the server. This, in case you’re wondering is a very serious vulnerability that should have been addressed immediately.

Local File Inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files on a server through the web browser.

UPDATE IMMEDIATELY!!!

Attacks In The Wild

We thought it’d be in our interest to see how active attacks against this vulnerability were. We turned to our WAF logs and found that this vulnerability is being actively attacked in the wild. Today alone, there were 64 different IP addresses trying to trigger this vulnerability on more than 1,000 different websites within our environment.

Here is a snippet of what to look for in your access logs:

Tanner B. Roark ( ; born October 5, 1986) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Washington Nationals, Cincinnati Reds, and Oakland Athletics. He played college baseball at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Professional career

Early career
Roark played one season with the Southern Illinois Miners of the independent Frontier League in 2008.  In 3 games, he was 0–2 with a 21.41 ERA.  In just 9.2 innings, he gave up 23 hits along with 25 runs while striking out 11.

Roark was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 25th round of the 2008 Amateur Player Draft. On July 31, 2010, he was traded, along with Ryan Tatusko, to the Washington Nationals in exchange for Cristian Guzmán.

In 2011, he was promoted to Triple-A Syracuse, and posted, in 28 games (26 starts) an unremarkable 6–17 record, but he posted a 4.39 ERA with 7.9 strikeouts and 2.9 walks per nine innings. He began the 2012 season in Syracuse as a starter, then joined the bullpen for 20 relief appearances. Roark moved back to the rotation and had the best stretch of his career, allowing only 12 earned runs over  innings in eight starts.

Washington Nationals

On August 6, 2013, Roark was called up to the majors for the first time, and on the next day pitched two innings of scoreless relief, allowing only one hit. By the end of August he had appeared in nine games in relief, allowing earned runs only twice, and compiling an ERA of 1.19 over  innings. On September 7 Roark made his first major league start against the Miami Marlins, pitching six innings, allowing no runs and four hits, no walks, and four strikeouts, getting the win. Roark's dominance continued with a September 17 start against the rival Atlanta Braves in which he pitched seven innings and allowed no runs on just three baserunners. His ERA dropped to 1.08 in  innings. He finished 7-1 in 14 games (5 starts).

On April 26, 2014, Roark threw his first career complete game shutout (with a perfect game until the 6th), allowing only 3 hits in a 4–0 win over the San Diego Padres. In 31 starts, Roark finished 15-10 with a 2.85 ERA in  innings.  

In 2015, Roark was shifted to the bullpen after the team acquired a few starting pitchers. In 40 games (12 starts), Roark finished 4-7 with an ERA of 4.38 in 111 innings. 

The 2016 season saw Roark put back in the rotation and establish career bests in wins (16), ERA (2.83), innings (210) and strikeouts (172).  For the 2016 season he led the majors in giving up the",625,11, lowest percentage of hard-hit balls (24.3

William J. Baxley, Atty. Gen., Montgomery, and Quentin Q. Brown, Asst. Atty. Gen., Birmingham, for the State.
LEIGH M. CLARK, Supernumerary Circuit Judge.
This is an appeal from a conviction of rape and a sentence to the penitentiary for ten years.
According to the testimony of the alleged victim, she was awakened by an intruder in her apartment about 3:00 A.M., March 1, 1975. She was sleeping alone in a bed. The only other occupants of the apartment at the time were her two children of the ages of six and three years, who were sleeping in an adjoining room. She had been recently divorced. She went to bed the evening before at about nine or ten o'clock after she had put the children to bed. She left the window of their bedroom slightly cracked; she went to bed in the nude as was her custom; she was awakened by being poked with a sharp object, which she did not identify at the time but testified that it had the appearance of a letter opener. When she turned over and saw the intruder she observed that he had a handkerchief across the lower part of his face. There was conversation between them as to who else was in the apartment. The man climbed in bed with her and had intercourse with her; she did not resist. She was positive in her identification of defendant;[1] she had never seen him before. Promptly after he left through a door, she locked the doors and closed and locked the windows and checked the children, whom she found asleep. She then went into the bathroom, took a hot bath and went through a feminine cleansing process. She put on her clothes, bundled up her children, got in her car and went to a pay phone booth and called her ex-husband. There was no phone in her apartment. When her ex-husband arrived they took the children to her mother's home; then she and her ex-husband went to the police station and reported the incident to the police.
*743 Defendant did not testify, but members of his family testified to the effect that on the night of the alleged crime he went to bed at a place some four miles from the scene of the crime, approximately an hour prior to its commission, and that he had no means of transportation sufficient to place him there at the time the crime was committed.
Appellant does not contend that the failure of the woman to physically resist precluded a conviction. The rule has been stated time and again to the contrary. We apply here what was said in Rudolph v. State, 275 Ala. 115, 152 So.2d 662:
""The offense of rape is complete when the woman is made to yield through fear. Hooper v. State, 106 Ala. 41, 17 So. 679. The evidence in this case clearly supports a finding that the prosecutrix yielded to her assailant because of fear that her life was in danger. The evidence was not only sufficient to take the case to the jury on the charge of rape, but was amply sufficient to support the verdict of the jury.""
Appellant's counsel, who was appointed to defend him on the trial and to represent him on appeal, in view of his indigency, has ably argued here as he contended there that ""the circumstances of her divorce and... relationship with her former husband, which appeared to be close in view of her calling upon him immediately following the claimed rape"" justified his efforts to explore and bring before the jury ""the possible bad actual character for chastity of the prosecuting witness."" The only cases relied upon by appellant are McQuirk v. State, 84 Ala. 435, 4 So. 775 (1888); Stone v. State, 243 Ala. 605, 11 So.2d 386 (1943); Brown v. State, 50 Ala.App. 471, 280 So.2d 177, cert. denied 291 Ala. 774, 280 So.2d 182 (1973). No support for the position of counsel for defendant-appellant is to be found in the cases cited, singly or collectively. All three recognize the principle that the general reputation of the prosecutrix for unchastity can be shown by defendant in a rape case. Such was not sought to be shown here. What was held in McQuirk and Stone is stated in McElroy, Law",975,11," of Evidence in Alabama, § 32.01:

Before CHRISTIE, C.J., HORSEY and WALSH, JJ.
In this appeal from his conviction for second degree attempted robbery and resisting arrest, the defendant claims that he was denied due process of law by prosecutorial misconduct in the form of impermissible cross-examination at trial. We agree that, in one respect, the prosecutor's cross-examination infringed upon the defendant's right to post-arrest silence and accordingly reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.

I
The facts underlying the charges against the defendant are not complicated. The complaining witness, John McClendon, an elderly man who was personally acquainted with the defendant, claims that the defendant accosted him on the street, knocked him to the ground and unsuccessfully attempted to remove money from the victim's coat. A plain clothes policeman quickly responded to the incident, and apprehended the defendant after a three block chase. The defendant testified at trial that McClendon had spit on the defendant and, *409 after an exchange of words, threatened to cut the defendant with a knife. The defendant responded by pushing McClendon to the ground, but denied that he had attempted to rob him. There were no independent eyewitnesses to the event and there is some indication that McClendon had been drinking at the time of the altercation.
The defendant testified to his version of the incident and during the course of cross-examination the following colloquy occurred:
Q. You have been incarcerated since this incident on the 12th of December, 1984?
A. Yes.
Q. Because you can't raise the bail?
A. Yes.
Q. When did you know approximately that you were charged with the attempted robbery in the first degree?
A. From the police station.
Q. Right. When you were arrested, right?
A. Yes.
Q. But according to you, this wasn't no robbery, right?
A. Right.
Q. So, you are sitting down in where, Gander Hill?
A. Yes.
Q. From the 12th of December?
A. Yes.
Q. To the present time?
A. (The defendant nodded his head in the affirmative.)
Q. Pending this trial here for robbery or attempted robbery first degree?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you make any efforts to contact the Governor of the State concerning, you know, this injustice that you were being held on a charge that you had nothing to do with?
A. No, I haven't.
MR. WILSON: Objection, Your Honor. The Governor has never interceded in any of my cases.
THE COURT: Objection sustained.
Following an unreported sidebar conference, the jury was excused and defense counsel moved for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor's line of questioning was ""totally irrelevant"" and ""highly prejudicial"" because it emphasized the defendant's pretrial incarceration. The trial judge denied defense counsel's motion for a mistrial but did give a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the fact of the defendant's ""whereabouts"" since the day of the defendant's arrest.
After his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial which was denied on the ground that the curative instruction was sufficient to cure any prejudice against the defendant. The court also noted that a problem arose because ""the cross-examination of the defendant with reference to his version of events led almost inevitably to questioning of his status. The situation which developed was of the defendant's own making and not something initiated by the prosecutor.""
On appeal, the defendant has renewed his objection to the prosecutor's questioning. He contends that the cross-examination was not only an improper emphasis on the fact of his pretrial incarceration but was also an attempt to impeach his trial testimony by calling attention to his pretrial silence  a fundamental constitutional right.

II
We first address the question posed and preserved by defense counsel's objection during trial: whether the prosecutor's questions relating to the defendant's pretrial incarceration were so egregious as to warrant the sanction of a mistrial. Defendant contends that the deliberate reference to his four month pretrial incarceration so prejudiced him in the eyes of the jurors that the presumption of innocence was weakened beyond the curative effect of the trial",1001,11," judge's instruction to disregard such reference.

Class Cast Exception retrieving Chosen date from childfragment to show in parent fragment

I have a parentfragment called Planning in which I want to show a DialogFragment called DatePickerfragment.The DatePickerFragment has a button that when clicked, will show a datepicker for the user. The user selects a date and that date should be passed to the Parent Fragment in a textview called 'date'.
Unfortunately, everytime I click the button the app crashes with this error:
java.lang.ClassCastException: com.example.android.meat_timealpha10.Activities.MainActivity cannot be cast to android.app.DatePickerDialog$OnDateSetListener
    at com.example.android.meat_timealpha10.Fragments.DatePickerFragment.onCreateDialog(DatePickerFragment.java:29)

I know where the error is but I don't know how to fix it.
It refers to this line in the DatePickerDialogFragment:
return new DatePickerDialog(getActivity(), (DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener)getActivity(), year, month, day );

The thing is I followed a youtube video and the guy doesn't seem to have any issues. Then again, he doesn't use nested fragments like me.
Does anyone know how to fix that error so that the chosen date gets displayed in the textview?

Theorem \[thm:uncentered\] can also be used to study ${\left\Vert {{{\bm{R}}}} \right\Vert}$ by combining it with the estimates $${\left\Vert { {\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}}{{\bm{R}}} } \right\Vert} \ -\ \left( {\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}}{{\left\Vert { {{\bm{R}}} - {\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}}{{\bm{R}}} } \right\Vert}^2} \right)^{1/2}

They avoid asking ""what if?""

""What if?"" statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, which are detrimental to self-control. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you'll spend taking action and staying productive (staying productive also happens to calm you down and keep you focused). Productive people know that asking ""what if? will only take them to a place they don't want — or need — to go. Of course, scenario planning is a necessary and effective strategic planning technique. The key distinction here is to recognize the difference between worry and strategic thinking.

Just thinking a positive thought can help you stay focused. aigle_dore/Flickr

They stay positive.

Positive thoughts help you exercise self-control by focusing your brain's attention onto the rewards you will receive for your effort. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, self-control is relatively easy.

When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, self-control is a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, or will happen, no matter how small. If you can't think of something from the current day, reflect on the past and look to the future. The point here is that you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative, so that you don't lose focus.

They eat.

File this one in the counter-intuitive category, especially if you're having trouble controlling your eating. Your brain burns heavily into your stores of glucose when attempting to exert self-control. If your blood sugar is low, you are far more likely to succumb to destructive impulses. Sugary foods spike your sugar levels quickly and leave you drained and vulnerable to impulsive behavior shortly thereafter. Eating something that provides a slow burn for your body, such as whole grain rice or meat, will give you a longer window of self-control.

Congressional Republicans want to pass a tax bill by Thanksgiving, and President Trump wants to sign it by Christmas. Right in the middle of that stretch lies the Dec. 8 deadline to pass legislation funding the government.

If Republicans and Democrats can't agree to a new spending plan, or at least a stopgap measure that Democrats say they don't want, the government will shut down.

Tom Cole Thomas (Tom) Jeffrey ColeBottom line House approves.3 trillion spending package for 2021 Multiple lawmakers self-quarantine after exposure to Gohmert MORE (R-Okla.), a key member of the House Appropriations Committee.

Complicating things further, even a short-term deal to push back the Dec. 8 deadline wouldn’t buy lawmakers much time.

In mid-January, budgetary caps will kick in and cause across-the-board cuts to government spending. The Treasury Department estimated there would also be a January deadline for raising the debt ceiling.

But the push for tax reform is expected to be all-consuming, pushing the funding issues aside.

House Republicans delayed the release of the bill by one day this week as they worked out internal differences. They hope to start marking up the bill in committee next week and pass it the following week on the House floor, despite internal opposition to provisions dealing with state and local taxes.

The Senate is planning to release its own tax bill, which is expected to have significant differences from the House’s version. They aim to pass that bill before Thanksgiving as well.

Both chambers take a recess the week of Thanksgiving, further squeezing the legislative timeline.

When lawmakers return, they will have just two weeks until the Dec. 8 deadline, which has sparked some talk of passing a continuing resolution (CR), a stopgap measure that keeps government funding unchanged. Republican leadership is even considering pushing the whole debate into February, a last resort that Democrats oppose.

“I have heard rumors that we would set aside negotiating an omnibus and do a CR instead because Republicans are so hellbent on passing tax cuts for the wealthiest and corporations that they simply don’t have time to walk and chew gum at the same time,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

A central obstacle is that work on spending bills cannot proceed until Democratic and Republican leaders agree on a top-line spending number, and it’s unclear where the starting point for negotiations is.

“The quicker they can get us a set of numbers, the quicker we can resolve through and start checking things off, and then we’re just down to a few big items,” Cole said.

UWP Grid RowSpan with ScroolViewer

If you paste this code in the mainpage of a new UWP app (or look at the 1st picture) you can see that the orange grid is taking more space than needed (VerticalAlignment is set to top). To make it work like it should, you have to set the 2nd row's height of this grid to Auto (see 2nd picture). The problem is that I want to give the extra space to the 2nd/last row and not to distribute it across all rows.
Putting the controls in the left column inside their own grid works (obviously, because there is no rowspan) but I can't do that because when the screen narrows the stackpanel in the right column goes inside a row in the left column.
The second problem is that if you click on the orange/green/yellow space, focus goes always to the textbox in the first row (yellow).

Blockchains remain agile and functioning based on the active contributions from its community members. It involves the users actively conducting transactions on the network, like using dApps or performing transactions, or contributing through their network level activities of mining, transaction authentication, and node operations.

QTUM appears to have generated good traction, and its website claims that the number of global nodes contributing to its network has shot up to 7,241, the third highest behind Ethereum (20,000) and Bitcoin (13,000). However, more than 83% of QTUM nodes are concentrated in the Asian countries, with 65% operating from China alone. Outside Asia, global nodes are primarily in the U.S. with smaller numbers in Germany, Canada and Australia. Still, the total non-Asian global node locations constitute a little over 10 percent. It gives enough room and new unexplored markets for QTUM to expand in the new geographies.

Beyond such infrastructure development, QTUM’s business initiatives have been largely concentrated in the Asian region. For instance, QTUM is working with Qihoo 360, Chinese cybersecurity firm, to build a solution based on the blockchain. Hong Kong-based Baofeng, which serves video content to over 200 million users, has partnered QTUM to develop a decentralized content delivery network. Gaming company Bingo has announced to use QTUM blockchain to improve on the user experience, data accessibility, and price transparency. Messaging service BeeChat that has two million users, and social media network Mithril are using QTUM blockchain for their operations.

The region of origin for a particular initiative usually sees a higher level of interest. Additionally, the approach to newer markets can be supplemented by new updates and features, which makes the venture more attractive to existing as well as new participants. QTUM is attempting to hit on these notes with many new updates recently released and few major initiatives announced for the near future. The QTUM team is also stressing on the need for marketing and user-engagement initiatives, something which has been overlooked so far and may help in bringing more global users onboard.

Founder Patrick Dai said “We’ve been focusing on building the very best technology this year. But we realize we have not put enough effort into marketing and community management recently. We are working on this and will push QTUM once again to",662,11," massive adoption.”

561,0,26697,1025," the original judgment and sentence. See King, slip op. at 8. Because the clerk of the convicting court did not certify the copy of the judgment and sentence provided by the custodian of the TDC, we hold that the contents of the pen packet were not ""certified as correct by the custodian,"" and thus not admissible under rule 902.
The State also contends that the pen packet was admissible pursuant to Texas Rule of Criminal Evidence 901. Rule 901 provides that authentication is satisfied by evidence supporting a finding that the matter is what its proponent claims. The State argues that rule 901(b)(7) should control the admission of the pen packet. Rule 901(b)(7) provides:
(7) Public Records and Reports. Evidence that a writing authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact recorded or filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, is from the public office where items of this nature are kept.
Tex.R.Crim.Evid. 901(b)(7).
The same concerns regarding the reliability of the copy of the judgment and sentence exist as to its admission under rule 901 as under rule 902. While the copy of the judgment and sentence is filed at the TDC, there is no assurance of reliability of the copy absent a certification from the clerk of the convicting court.
The State relies on Rodasti v. State, 749 S.W.2d 161 (Tex.App.Houston [1st Dist.] 1988), remanded, No. 424-88 (Tex.Crim. App., Nov. 1, 1989) as authority for the admissibility of the pen packet under rules 901 and 902.

Palindromic numbers whose squares are palindromic too

In any base $b>2$, there are infinite palindromic numbers whose squares are palindromic too: for any $n\geq 0$, if $a_n:=1\underbrace{0\dots 0}_{\text{n}}1_b$ then 
$a_n^2=1\underbrace{0\dots 0}_{\text{n}}2\underbrace{0\dots 0}_{\text{n}}1_b$.
Is this property true also in base $2$? 

A:

There are only finitely many base-$2$ palindromes whose square is also a base-$2$ palindrome. Namely, the trivial $0$ (if one counts that as a palindrome), $1$, and the not-quite-trivial $3 = 11_2$.
To see that, let's first look at numbers with few bits set. There's only one number with no bits set, $0$. Whether that should count as a palindrome is left to the reader. There's only one base-$2$ palindrome with exactly one bit set, namely $1$. For base-$2$ palindromes with exactly two bits set, we easily see that $3$ is the only one whose square is also a base-$2$ palindrome. For if $x = 2^k + 1$ with $k \geqslant 2$, then $x^2 = 2^{2k} + 2^{k+1} + 1$, and there are only $k-2$ zeros between the first two ones, and $k$ zeros between the last two ones, hence $x^2$ is not a base-$2$ palindrome. Base-$2$ palindromes with exactly three bits set are of the form $x = 2^{2k} + 2^k + 1$, and then $x^2 = 2^{4k} + 2^{3k+1} + 2^{2k+1} + 2^{2k} + 2^{k+1} + 1$. For $k \geqslant 2$, we have $4k > 3k+1 > 2k+1 > 2k > k+1 > 0$, and we again have only $k-2$ zeros between the first two ones, and $k$ zeros between the last two ones in the binary representation of $x^2$. For $k = 1$ we have $x = 7$ and $x^2 = 49 = 110001_2$ which also isn't a base-$2$ palindrome.
So let's finally look at base-$2$ palindromes with at least four bits set. These are of the form $x = 2^k + 2^{k-a} + \dotsc + 2^a + 1$ with $1 \leqslant a < \frac{k}{2}$. Writing $x = 1 + 2^a\cdot u$ with $u$ odd, we see that $x^2 = 1 + 2^{a+1} u + 2^{2a}u^2$, so there are at least $a$ zeros between the last two ones in the binary representation of $x^2$ (exactly $a$ if $a \geqslant 2$, at least $2$ if $a = 1$). At the front, writing $x = 2^k + v$, with $2^{k-a} < v < 2^{k+1-a}$, we see that $x^2 = 2^{2k} + 2^{k+1}v + v^2$, and
$$2^{2k+1-a} < 2^{k+1}v + v^2 < 2^{2k+2-a} + 2^{2k+2-2a}, \tag{$\ast$}$$
so there are at most $a-2$ zeros between the first two ones",895,11, in the binary representation of $x^2$ and

As someone who has known Elliot from the Chicago scene for the last ~10 years,
I have to push back on this.

Elliot hustled his ass off doing his own thing, working recruiting for
Groupon, working as one of the founding employees of DevBootcamp Chicago to
get graduates gigs (and doing so with great success), and then back to his own
recruiting before launching Human Predictions based on feedback from his
clients and experiences.

He became, at least in my circles, the most trusted recruiter amongst
developers. Many thought of him as more of an ""agent"" than a recruiter.
Someone you could grab coffee with every six months who'd keep you in mind if
the perfect gig came up. I referred friends to him all the time without
concern that he'd spam them, hard-sell them, put them in whatever spot that
was open just to reap the commission. He's always had the",379,11," developer's interest
in mind first and foremost.

On March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would purchase LIN Media and its stations, including WKBN-TV, WYFX-LD, and the SSA and JSA with WYTV, in a $1.6 billion merger. The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, but a condition of the deal requires Media General to end the JSA between WKBN-TV and WYTV within two years due to tighter regulations on such deals. The merger was completed on December 19. Despite the conditions, WKBN-TV continues to operate WYTV, including after Nexstar acquired Media General in early 2017.

On February 12, 2015, WKBN-TV launched a revolutionary high-tech news set. The set utilizes Virtual and Augmented Reality elements, computer-generated designs that are layered on real scenic elements. Pioneering this new set, WKBN is one of the only local broadcast stations in the entire country to utilize this technology. Using state of the art technology, the new look is both dynamic and flexible, allowing the station an unlimited number of options for continuous design enhancements.

In 2017, WKBN-TV sold its spectrum for $34 million as part of the FCC's spectrum reallocation program and will move its broadcasting to sister station WYTV's frequency. WKBN-TV moved to WYTV's frequency on April 23, 2018. In order to make room for WKBN-TV, Ion Television moved from 27.3 to WYFX's 19.3 while Bounce TV moved from 33.3 to WYFX 19.4.

Digital channels
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:

Programming
Syndicated programming on this station includes Jeopardy!, Wheel of Fortune, and The Dr. Oz Show among others. All are distributed by CBS Television Distribution. (Before 2010, the former two shows aired on WYTV from the beginning.)

News operation
WKBN presently broadcasts 31 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5½ hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and 1½ hours on Sundays).

WKBN established a weekday morning program in 1992. On January 23, 2006, WYFX's First News at 10 on Fox 17/62 (produced by WKBN) became the area's only hour-long prime time broadcast on weeknights while remaining thirty minutes on weekends.

After a rebranding occurred in 2008, the title changed to First News on Fox. For a period, WYFX's broadcast competed with another newscast seen at the same time on MyNetwork affiliate WYTV-DT2 that was produced by its parent ABC station. There is also a two-hour weekday morning show seen on WYFX while WKBN broadcasts CBS This Morning. Known as First News This Morning on Fox, the show is essentially an extension of the CBS affiliate's show offering a local alternative.

In December 2007, the news departments of WKBN and WYTV physically merged. As a result, over forty personnel at WYTV and six at WKBN were laid-off. Under the shared services agreement, this station began producing newscasts on the ABC affiliate from a secondary set at the Sunset Boulevard studios. A previous plan calling for WYTV to build satellite streetside studios in Downtown Youngstown were abandoned due to the consolidation. The current operational status of its Doppler weather radar based at the old facility on Shady Run Road is unknown. The two stations gradually had their on-air looks mirror each other while their respective web sites became identical. New logos for the stations and updated websites debuted in January 2009 including combined operations for sports and weather.

Soybean seeds (*Glycine max* (L.) Merr) variety Savana were planted in ProMix BX (Premier Tech Horticulture, Canada) in 200-seed trays, in a controlled environment room (27 °C 16:8 day/night). After 7 days, the plants were transplanted into 4.5 inch pots and placed in a Conviron environmental chamber (Winnipeg, Canada) with fluorescent lamps Sylvania Hg Pentron 4100 K, 39 W (Osram Sylvania, USA), After an additional 14 days, drought stress was initiated. The environmental chamber was set at 16:8 day/night with the temperature 27 °C, \~400 µmol/m^2^/s PAR intensity, 600 ppm CO~2~ and 60 % relative humidity. Due to additional heat being generated by the lights, the temperature reached 33 °C during the day. Twice a week the plants were treated with 100 mL solution of 0.5 g/L 20-8-20 (Plant Products, Canada) or 0.5 g/L 20-8-20 plus 7.0 mL/L Acadian^®^. On Day 21, plants were treated with 1.0 g/L 20-8-20 or 1.0 g/L 20-8-20 plus 7.0 mL/L Acadian^®^ until the soil was completely saturated and the excess liquid ran through the bottom of the pots (\~300 mL). This equalised the soil moisture content at \~70 % for the onset of drought stress and no further water was applied. Each experiment consisted of two plants (one treated, one control). Three separate experiments were conducted using a total of six plants (three treated, three control). A 5-day stress-recovery experiment with re-watering on the fifth day allowed observation of all stages of drought stress, i.e., stress response (Day 3), adaptation (Day 4) and recovery (Day 5). Data for leaf temperatures and angles were recorded from one pot as a biological replicate (two pots per experiment). Statistics were conducted on results from three experiments.

The man accused in Phoenix’s “Canal Killer” case may have his ancestors to blame for his 2015 arrest.

Records show forensic genealogy was key in leading police to Bryan Patrick Miller, a man now facing a death-penalty trial in the early 1990s slayings of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas.

Using a method with little precedent in the world of criminal justice, a California genealogist named Colleen Fitzpatrick handed police what would amount to a case-busting lead: the suspect’s last name.

“The name Miller came up in my analysis,” Fitzpatrick wrote in an email that she later forwarded to investigators.

Miller, a now-44-year-old father, was arrested within weeks of Fitzpatrick’s emails with police. His trial is scheduled to begin April 28",192,11,".

573,0,26530,0,"A team of researchers from universities in London and Rome have published a paper in which they claim that many of the world's top VPN providers leak IPv6 traffic. TorrentFreak has spoken to several companies highlighted in the report and today we publish their responses.

As Internet users seek to bypass censorship, boost privacy and achieve a level of anonymity, VPN services have stepped in with commercial solutions to assist with these aims. The uptake among consumers has been impressive.

Reviews of VPN services are commonplace and usually base their ratings on price and speed. At TorrentFreak we examine many services annually, but with a focus on privacy issues instead.

Now a team of researchers from universities in London and Rome have published a paper titled A Glance through the VPN Looking Glass: IPv6 Leakage and DNS Hijacking in Commercial VPN clients. (pdf) after investigating 14 popular services on the market today.

“Our findings confirm the criticality of the current situation: many of these providers leak all, or a critical part of the user traffic in mildly adversarial environments. The reasons for these failings are diverse, not least the poorly defined, poorly explored nature of VPN usage, requirements and threat models,” the researchers write.

While noting that all providers are able to successfully send data through an encrypted tunnel, the paper claims that problems arise during the second stage of the VPN client’s operation: traffic redirection.

“The problem stems from the fact that routing tables are a resource that is concurrently managed by the operating system, which is unaware of the security requirements of the VPN client,” the researchers write.

This means that changes to the routing table (whether they are malicious or accidental) could result in traffic circumventing the VPN tunnel and leaking to other interfaces.

IPv6 VPN Traffic Leakage

“The vulnerability is driven by the fact that, whereas all VPN clients manipulate the IPv4 routing table, they tend to ignore the IPv6 routing table. No rules are added to redirect IPv6 traffic into the tunnel. This can result in all IPv6 traffic bypassing the VPN’s virtual interface,” the researchers explain.

As illustrated by the chart above, the paper claims that all desktop clients (except for those provided by Private Internet Access, Mullvad and VyprVPN) leaked “the entirety” of IPv6 traffic, while all providers except Astrill were vulnerable to IPv6 DNS hijacking attacks.

The paper was covered yesterday by The Register with the scary-sounding title “VPNs are so insecure you might as well wear a KICK ME sign” but without any input from the providers in question. We decided to contact a few of them for their take on the paper.

PureVPN told TF that they “take the security of our customers very seriously and thus, a dedicated team has been assigned to look into the matter.” Other providers had already received advanced notice of the paper.

“At least for AirVPN the paper is outdated,” AirVPN told TorrentFreak.

“We think that the researchers, who kindly sent the paper to us many months in advance and were warned about that, had no time to fix [the paper] before publication. There is nothing to worry about for AirVPN.”

The number of times antibiotics were used differed by 1 in 9 of the patients and by 2 in 2 patients; such differences were due to the uncontrolled and spontaneous use of antibiotics prescribed at previous consultations. The agreement was 96.8s% between the parent reports and the database for the year prior to the diagnosis of asthma. For the year after the diagnosis, there were no differences, i.e. the agreement was 100s%.

The median number of upper airway diseases before diagnosis of asthma was 5 \[interquartile range (IQR) = 6\] per year which decreased to 1 (IQR = 3) after treatment (p \< 0.001). The median number of lower airway diseases before diagnosis of 2 (IQR = 5) per year dropped to 0 after treatment (p \< 0.001). The annual median number of asthma episodes before the asthma diagnosis was 4 (IQR = 8), decreasing to 0 (IQR = 2) in the year after treatment (p \< 0.001; fig. [1](#F1){ref-type=""fig""}).

==========

This study showed that the frequency of antibiotic usage and the number of asthma episodes decreased to a statistically significant level after patients received appropriate treatment and regular follow-up by specialists.

The asthmatic children had more doctor visits, due to the fact that they are more symptomatic; this has been reported previously \[[@B3],[@B9]\]. The possibility of misdiagnosing an acute asthma episode together with symptoms of increasing severity, like bronchiolitis, atypical pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections, means clinicians may choose to treat multiple possible etiologies \[[@B1]\]. Generally, 35s% of asthmatics who experience episodes of respiratory tract infections are treated with antibiotics \[[@B10]\], even though these infections are most commonly viral in origin and trigger wheezing in young children \[[@B11]\]. Prior to admission to our clinic, the children had been frequently diagnosed with upper and lower airway infections, and so the use of antibiotics was high, which is similar to previous studies \[[@B1],[@B12]\]. Reasons for using antibiotics include diagnostic uncertainty, the prophylaxis of secondary infections, an attempt to utilize the anti-inflammatory properties of macrolide antibiotics and the belief that unknown or noncultivable bacteria may be important in some asthmatic patients \[[@B1],[@B12]\]. Marra et al. \[[@B6]\] demonstrated that children eventually diagnosed with asthma had a higher rate",699,11, of antibiotic usage than those who had never been diagnosed with

Nate Parker and Predators of Faith

By Sikivu Hutchinson

A
man of deep faith. That is the lofty
mantle actor/director Nate Parker has self-righteously ascribed to himself in a
Facebook post written in response to the
firestorm around his alleged rape of a fellow student at disgraced Penn State
University in 1999.

The details of the incident involving the unnamed
victim, Parker and his Birth of a Nation
writing partner Jean Celestin, have rocked
the Internet. Celestin was initially convicted
but the ruling was overturned on appeal four years later. Parker was acquitted partly because the jury
concluded that the victim couldn’t have been raped because she had had “consensual
sex” with him prior to the attack. According
to court documents, Parker and Celestin harassed and stalked the victim. After attempting suicide she sued the
university, alleging that it had not protected her from the harassment. In 2012, she died by suicide after battling
PTSD and depression, reportedly due to the sexual assault.

Parker's and Celestin’s status as athletes at a
university which has a history
of complicity in sexual assault is an especially ugly irony. Their commodity value to Penn no doubt
shielded them from the long jail sentence that almost certainly would have been
slapped on two ordinary young black men charged with raping a white woman.

Yet,
the phrase “man of faith” resonates with many black audiences. In this instance
it’s designed to elicit an unquestioning cultural solidarity that Parker does
not deserve.

The
implication that “faith” defines morality is the gospel for a majority of the
American public in general and African Americans in particular. Expressing regret for his youthful “carelessness”,
Parker wrote that “there is morality; no one who calls himself a man of faith should
even be in [that] situation”. Presumably a “man of faith”, one who adheres to
the bible (with its prescriptions for the subordination and rape of women,
damnation of gays, and murder of infidels) would have held himself to a higher
standard of conduct.

For sexual
assault survivors, the phrase is both bludgeon and vise.

It wasn’t until I started being open and honest about my own journey that I realized just how misconstrued the term “self-love” is. At first I was really thrown off by some of the reactions I encountered, to the point where I even started to second guess myself and my decisions, but eventually I learned to stop taking offense. I came to the conclusion that any benighted response I was met with was just a lack of understanding on the person’s part and I have since done my best to educate, whenever necessary, on the true motivations behind a self-love journey.

To this day, I get a lot of comments like “What does that even mean?” and “I don’t really get what you’re trying to do here” and “Are you just tired of dating or something?” (Um, yeah, but that’s not the point).

My personal favorite though, and the one that I’m faced with most, is what I believe to be the absolute culmination of all ignorant thoughts and attitudes towards the self-love movement: “Isn’t that the world’s problem, that people love themselves too much and others too little? It just seems really selfish to me.”

Now, because I have personally grown a lot on this journey, it’s much easier today than it was in the beginning to control the intense eruption of emotions that I would feel at this accusation: the accusation that I am, and that anyone else who pursues self-love is, in fact selfish for taking the time to heal. All of the things that I would want to say in reply to this notion, some less eloquent and less gracious than others, can be simply sum up by saying: False. SO false.

This infuriating stigma stems from those who confuse, quite inaccurately, selfish love with self-love. And let me be clear, the two are completely, totally, indubitably different.

Selfish love comes from the need to take from others. It says “What I have isn’t enough, so I need to take from you in order to fill this need in me.” A lack of self-love is in actuality the very thing that births, breeds and encourages selfish behaviors.

When you are completely content with yourself and fully appreciate who you are, you don’t feel a need to take from others because you no longer have a void to fill. Instead, you can say confidently and honestly “I am full. I am complete. I have no desire to take from you because I have all that",569,11," I need. Instead, here, let me give."

As soon as Kevin Drum at Mother Jones absolved the CIA of spewing poison gas as a provocation, many on the Liberal Left cautiously threw their weight behind Obama and the thrill of waging a punitive war on Syria.

“Perhaps regime change is a good idea,” Tom Hayden speculated in The Nation.

Left paterfamilias Noam Chomsky, who generally shows an appreciation for the subtleties of covert action, claimed that America is not supplying its Al Qaeda mercenary army with arms – even though Eric Schmidt at The New York Times reported over a year ago that CIA officers in Turkey were “helping allies decide which Syrian opposition fighters across the border will receive arm.”

As if Hayden fomenting war and Chomsky covering for the CIA isn’t irony enough, Drum cleared the CIA in response to allegations of a provocation made by Rush Limbaugh. Which raises the question, what are the facts about the CIA’s penchant for “provoked responses” like the one in the Tonkin Gulf that started the Vietnam War?

Simply stated, black propaganda is one of many criminal but legally deniable things the CIA does. It often involves committing a heinous crime and blaming it on an enemy by planting false evidence, and then getting a foreign newspaper to print the CIA’s scripted version of events, which sympathetic journalists in America broadcast to the gullible public.

In the case of Syria, the CIA is using cooked Israeli “intelligence” as a catalyst – which is why, as Johnstone and Bricmont explain, the “intelligence” is so “dubious.”

Black propaganda has other “intelligence” applications as well, and is often used to recruit informants, and create deserters and defectors.

In his autobiography Soldier, Anthony Herbert told how he reported for duty in 1965 in Saigon at the joint CIA-military Specials Operations Group. The spooks asked him to join a secret psywar program. “What they wanted me to do was to take charge of execution teams that wiped out entire families and tried to make it look as though the VC themselves had done the killing. The rationale was that other Vietnamese would see that the VC had killed another VC and would be frightened away from becoming VC themselves. Of course, the villagers would then be inclined to some sort of allegiance to our side.”

As counter-terror guru David Galula explained, “Pseudo insurgents are a way to get intelligence and sow suspicion at the same time between the real guerrillas and the population.”

In a similar case in 1964, a famous CIA propaganda officer organized three armed “survey teams” which operated in neighboring hamlets simultaneously. When Vietcong propaganda teams departed from a hamlet, his cut-throat cadre would move in and speak to one person from each household, so the VC “would have to punish everyone after we left.”

In other words the CIA’s mercenaries (like some the CIA’s mercenaries in Syria) were provocateurs, setting people up for recriminations, for intelligence and publicity purposes.

Here’s another example: in 1964, CIA officer Nelson Brickham worked in the Sino-Soviet Relations Branch, where he managed black propaganda operations designed to cause friction between the USSR and China. At the heart of these black ops were false flag recruitments, in which CIA case officers posed as Soviet intelligence officers and, using actual Soviet cipher systems and methodology, recruited Chinese diplomats, who believed they were working for the Russians. The CIA case officers used the Chinese dupes to create all manner of mischief.

Brickham in 1967 created the Phoenix program in South Vietnam. The Phoenix program’s operations chief in 1970, Colonel Thomas McGrevey, had a “penetration agent” inside COSVN – the Central Office of South Vietnam. COSVN’s deputy finance director was the penetration agent. The deputy alerted McGrevey when the finance director was going on vacation, enabling McGrevey to mount a black propaganda campaign which framed the finance director for running off with embezzled funds.

A circular about the Phoenix program issued by the revolutionary Security Service in 1970, described how the nationalists viewed the CIA. As stated in the circular, “the most wicked maneuvers” of the CIA “have been to seek out every means by which to terrorize revolutionary families and force the people to disclose the location of our agents and join the People’s Self-Defense Force. They also spread false rumors. Their main purpose is to jeopardize the prestige of the revolutionary families, create dissension between them",984,11," and the people, and destroy the people’s"

History

From the first Dutch settlers in the early 17th century to the present day, Sussex County has seen many visitors. Some of those visitors have stayed, farming the land, harvesting resources, working and calling this new land home. The largest, but historically least populous, county in the state of Delaware, Sussex County has had its share in the limelight of history. Below are some key dates in Sussex County and Delaware's history:

1609 – Henry Hudson and his crew aboard the Half Moon enter the mouth of what will become known as Delaware Bay.

1631 – Dutch established a trading post in what is present-day Lewes, calling the colony Zwaanendael, or ""Valley of the Swans"".

1681-1682 – The King of England grants Pennsylvania and Delaware to William Penn, an English proprietor who names Delaware's southernmost county for his home county of Sussex in England. The land grant sets off years of disputes with the Calvert family of neighboring Maryland, who challenge the boundaries between Delaware and Maryland.

1704 – Delaware, also known as the ""Three Lower Colonies,"" is established as its own government independent of Pennsylvania, though still under English rule.

1768 to 1774 – English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon survey the boundary of Delaware, beginning in Delmar, working their way north to Pennsylvania and then west for the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland; the survey formalizes the boundary, and thus brings an end the decades of dispute that began with the Penns and Calverts.

1776 to 1783 – Revolutionary War.

1787 – Delaware becomes the first state to ratify the U.S. Constitution.

1791 – Georgetown platted out and established as the new County seat; the County seat had been located at Lewes, but was relocated to a more central portion of the County.

1813 – Lewes bombarded by the British during the War of 1812.

1830s to 1840s – Canning industry begins.

1859 – Railroad reaches Delmar. Farmers are now able to ship perishable goods outside of Delaware to cities such as Wilmington, Philadelphia and Baltimore.

1860 to 1865 – The Civil War period sees Delaware become a border state, siding with the Union. But Confederate sympathies run deep in southernmost Sussex County.

1903 – Sussex County Levy Court is abolished by Delaware General Assembly and reformed as a 10-member panel.

1915 – The Delaware General Assembly again abolishes and reforms the Levy Court, this time as a three-member board of commissioners; the new Levy Court takes effect in 1917.

1919 – Last ship built in Bethel, which had been a popular ship-building port along Broad Creek, a tributary of the Nanticoke River and Chesapeake Bay.

1923 – Cecile Steele of Ocean View orders 50 chicks for her egg-laying business, but instead receives 500 birds thanks to a clerical error. The foul-up gives birth to the modern broiler industry, and will",648,11," make Sussex County not only the birthplace, but the leading"

The Science of the Life of the Metaphorical City

Saigon is like all the other great cities of the world. It's the mess left over from people getting rich.

P J O'Rourke, Give War A Chance, 1992

That Homer's Odysseus saw many cities and knew the minds of their men signifies the increase of his wisdom through world-weary experience. The biblical depiction of the city is constantly overshadowed by the lost Jerusalem, and tends inevitably to Sodom and Gomorrah. For Sallust and for Bacon, the city is venal, awaiting its purchaser - Rome found its purchaser in Julius Ceaser: but his accession to the consulship through corruption and bribery is not an exclusively antique problem. The ends may justify the means when the means are the norm. Milton's cheerful man sees 'Towerd Cities' as pleasing with the 'busie humm of men' in L'Allegro, but just as Keats later sings that it is'very sweet to look into the fair and open face of heaven'... 'To one who has been long in city pent', so Milton, no doubt his inspiration:

As one who long in populous city pent,
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Air,
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe
Among the pleasant Villages and Farms
Adjoind, from each thing met conceives delight...

And yet these cities from antiquity would certainly seem to us rural dreams, and it is the countryside which now reeks of ordure. As my brother likes to say, 'I don't like the country. The country stinks of shit.'

We look at the city and see what it is expedient to see, but understanding the city is another matter, and we resort to metaphor in the absence of better ways to conceive them.

I knew a man who was employed as a planner in Slough, which always seemed to me to be too little too late. Surely as O'Rourke implies, the city is an accretion of the short-minded desires of money? In the grander scheme of things, isn't it an organic evolving creature, developing in ways without intention, from causes whose source may seem deliberate at the scale of the individual, but whose macroscopic expression is as blind as the brute force of evolution?

Researchers and economists at Arizona State University have apparently debunked the'metaphor' of the city as organism. But which metaphor of the city is it that they have debunked? The city as organ connected by the arteries of highways that conduct our cell-vehicles, carrying their payloads of organelle-humans with their protein-transactions? The city as evil chakra of the nation-body producing the tainted urges of consumers, driving us towards the un-nirvana of progress with the dark energy of desire? The city as phenotype, the built extension of man, fashioned from the technologies of industry to produce machines for existence? No, this is city-organism as biological consumer of literal energy, which even as it increases in scale linearly, consumes energy with a surprising and increasingly efficient non-linearity. This seems a rather modest metaphor of the city to pick issues with.

If one thinks of the human",687,11," mind as a device for pattern recognition, then both metaphor"

Bundt pans need a bit more TLC. My standard formula is to grease with vegetable shortening (solid Crisco) and then flour liberally, tapping out the excess. You want to make sure every nook and cranny is covered in both grease and butter. Some folks swear by the baking sprays that have flour in them, but I’ve never been a fan.

Production

According to James Robert Parish, in his book Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the idea for the Popeye musical had its basis in the bidding war for the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Annie between the two major studios vying for the rights, Columbia and Paramount. When Robert Evans found out that Paramount had lost the bidding for Annie, he held an executive meeting in which he asked about comic strip characters which the studio held the rights to which could also be used in order to create a movie musical, and one attendee said ""Popeye"".

At that time, even though King Features Syndicate (now a unit of Hearst) retained the television rights to Popeye and related characters, with Hanna-Barbera then producing the series The All-New Popeye Hour under license from King Features, Paramount had long held the theatrical rights to the Popeye character, due to the studio releasing Popeye cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios, respectively, from 1932 to 1957.

Evans commissioned Jules Feiffer to write a script. In 1977, he said he wanted Dustin Hoffman to play Popeye opposite Lily Tomlin as Olive Oyl, with John Schlesinger directing. Hoffman later dropped out due to creative differences with Feiffer. Gilda Radner, then a hot new star as an original cast",351,11," member of Saturday Night Live, was also considered for the"

592,0,28217,0,"The present invention relates to an absorbent article containing a superabsorbent polymer, which effectively prevents skin rash development without reducing the absorbing performance of the superabsorbent polymer. The present invention also relates to an absorbent article having an agent which has hardly been subjected to thermal history and by which scratches, rashes or inflammation of wearer"""" skin can be suppressed or cured. The present invention also relates to fiber or a fiber aggregate having skin-care effects and suitable for use in these absorbent articles.
Absorbent articles developed for preventing rash development on wearer""""s skin include those disclosed in WO96/16681 and WO96/16682. These publications show disposable diapers having a lotion containing an emollient applied to the topsheet. The lotion used contains an immobilizing agent for fixing the emollient to the topsheet.
Immobilized on the topsheet, the emollient hardly migrates to the wearer""""s skin so that not all the emollient applied to the topsheet participates in antiinflammation. Some immobilizing agents used for fixing the emollient irritate the skin to produce a rash. The lotion sometimes gets hard to cause small scratches on the skin, which can also result in a rash.
In producing the above-described disposable diapers, the emollient is melted together with the immobilizing agent, and the molten mixture is applied to a topsheet. That is, the emollient is repeatedly exposed to high temperature for a long time (thermal history) and, as a result, often undergoes thermal denaturation or thermal decomposition. The immobilizing agent itself and the emollient in the presence of the immobilizing agent tend to become hard to scratch the skin. These agents are difficult to apply uniformly, which is a false economy.
Further, the disclosed disposable diapers are liable to leak because the immobilizing agent used is hydrophobic so that liquid waste discharged on the topsheet is not allowed to quickly permeate through the topsheet, rather tending to flow thereon. In order to secure smooth permeation of liquid, the amount of the lotion applied should be reduced, or application of the lotion must be discontinuous, but such manipulations will ruin the effects that should have been produced. In addition, the area in the topsheet where the lotion is applied interferes with smooth permeation of the liquid waste, resulting in remaining the liquid waste on the topsheet. The liquid waste remained on the topsheet causes swell of the wearer""""s skin which leads to unfavorable skin rash due to, for example, scratch and infection of irritating substances.
There are some other known absorbent articles having a pharmacologically active ingredient to prevent a rash. However, without a proper choice of the active ingredient, the crosslinked structure of a superabsorbent polymer would be severed by the active ingredient to reduce liquid absorptivity and increase a back-flow. An increased back-flow brings skin overhydration, which accelerates a skin rash. A reduction in amount of the active ingredient only leads to a failure to exert the anti-rash effect.
Apart from the absorbent articles disclosed in the above publications, fibers having adhered thereto a skin-care agent have been proposed. Japanese Patent Laid-Open 5-44165 discloses chitosan-containing fiber, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open 8-60547 proposes sericin-containing fiber.
Chitosan and sericin generally have high crystallinity and low water solubility and are therefore not easy to apply in fiber processing. Specifically, chitosan or sericin precipitates and falls off while being adhered to fibers. As a result, the production equipment is soiled, and the resulting fiber has an insufficient add-on, and the adhesion is not uniform. A manipulation for increasing the add-on could result in more precipitation and fall-off, making a vicious circle.
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an absorbent article containing a superabsorbent polymer, which effectively prevents rash development without reducing the absorbing performance of the superabsorbent polymer.
Another object of the present invention is to provide an absorbent article having an agent fixed thereto with reduced involvement",879,11, of thermal history so that the agent keeps effective in suppressing
593,0,21974,0,"Anti-sense oligonucleotides are being developed to treat a variety of diseases, particularly viral infections, e.g. Matsukura et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 86, pgs. 4244-4448 (1989). An antisense oligonucleotide is a synthetic oligonucleotide of varying length, usually in the range of about 12 to 30 nucleotides, or nucleotide analogs, whose sequence is complementary to a predetermined segment of RNA, either freshly transcribed or messenger (mRNA), associated with some foreign or otherwise inappropriately expressed gene. It is believed that when an antisense oligonucleotide hybridizes to its target RNA, it either blocks translation or processing of the RNA or makes it susceptible to enzymatic degradation. One problem with this approach has been the difficulty of getting the antisense oligonucleotide to its target RNA in sufficient concentration and for sufficient duration to be effective in shutting down the synthesis of undesired proteins, e.g. viral enzymes, coat proteins, and the like. The susceptibility of the phosphodiester linkage of the oligonucleotides to nuclease digestion is believed to be an important cause of this difficulty, and has prompted the development of a variety of nucleoside oligomers linked by nuclease-resistant analogs of the natural phosphodiester bond, e.g. Miller et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,511,713 and Ts'o U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,863 (methyl- and arylphosphonates); Miro et al, Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 17, pgs. 8207-8219 (1989) (phosphoroselenoates); Brill et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 111, pg. 2321 (1989)(phosphorodithioates); and Matsukura et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 84, pgs. 7706-7710 (1987), and Gene, Vol. 72, pgs. 343-347 (1988) (phosphorothioates).
The phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate analogs are especially promising because they are highly nuclease-resistant, have the same charge as natural oligonucleotides, and are taken up by cells in effective amounts.
Phosphorothioates can be synthesized by automated DNA synthesizers using hydrogen phosphonate or phosphoramidite chemistries. In the former approach, the phosphonate backbone can be sulfurized in a single step off of the automated synthesizer after synthesis. This is advantageous because the phosphonate moieties are sulfurized by exposure to elemental sulfur dissolved in an organic solvent. Since the sulfur readily",589,11," precipitates out of solution, the off-column sulfur"

596,0,25337,0,"When we started building our Basket protocol in September 2017, we had an eye out for new Blockchain platforms, and were especially tethered to developments surrounding the rise and growth of NEO. Earlier this February, we started looking into the NEO Blockchain in much greater detail and found a lot of high-quality projects building on NEO on the back of strong platform potentials. Hence, from being a purely Ethereum-based project, we decided to pivot to a multi blockchain project on Ethereum as well as NEO — a radically new way to trade on a DEX.

Soon, you will be able to download and install a new WandX Desktop Application in line with the new way of the project. And in this post, I would like to highlight not just the features of our new desktop app but also elaborate on what our vision is, for WandX, in the coming year.

Our reasons to exist

Make crypto investments market accessible. For a new user looking to enter the crypto market, there’s fear and feelings of uncertainty around how to enter the market and how to work the market sentiments to buy and sell ‘tokens’ or digital assets meaningfully and in a risk-balanced way. Make DEX trading easy. For a new entrant in the crypto space, a centralized exchange, today, offers a far better user experience than a DEX, though a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) has proven advantages of security, non-centralized custody, and finality of the trade over a centralized exchange (CEX). Low liquidity, high price volatility. Due to low liquidity and high price volatility of most crypto assets, there’s uncertainty as to which Tokens to gain exposure to.

How we are solving for these

We have created what we call the ‘Basket protocol’.

The basket protocol enables users to buy, at one go, a bundle or a ‘Basket of Tokens’ on either NEO or ETH blockchains.

This helps users in building token portfolios easily and in a cost-effective manner, while potentially reducing volatility and balancing out many of the risks associated with individual token purchase. To add to that, this protocol is fully decentralized, meaning that custody of the Tokens is transferred directly from the creator of the Basket to the buyer, with no other central authority maintaining custody.

2. We have now created a one-stop, multi-blockchain decentralized exchange (DEX) on NEO and Ethereum, as a Desktop application, one that supports existing ledger wallets as well as allows creation of new wallets/importing of existing wallets within the app.

With this way of managing trading wallets, not only do users sign transactions to execute trades far more easily, they trade seamlessly on the various tokens issued on Ethereum as",575,11, well as NEO without having to jump from platform to platform

v.
The STATE of Florida, Appellee.
No. 89-745.
District Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District.
January 16, 1990.
*438 Peter Raben, Coconut Grove, for appellant.
Robert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., and Jorge Espinosa, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.
Before HUBBART, NESBITT and JORGENSON, JJ.
PER CURIAM.
The defendant, Miguel Angel Fernandez, appeals from a final judgment of conviction and sentence of life imprisonment for burglary of a structure with an assault or battery with a firearm, robbery with a firearm, and kidnapping with a firearm. We affirm the judgment of conviction. However, because the trial court erred in applying the sentencing guidelines, we remand for resentencing within the guidelines range.
First, we hold that the trial court did not err in excluding as hearsay two out-of-court statements relating to defendant's alibi defense. No offer of proof was made to indicate what the excluded evidence would have revealed. The Florida Evidence Code, Section 90.104(1)(b), Florida Statutes, provides:
(1) A court may predicate error, set aside or reverse a judgment, or grant a new trial on the basis of admitted or excluded evidence when a substantial right of the party is adversely affected and:
* * * * * *
(b) When the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer of proof or was apparent from the context within which the questions were asked.
""It is axiomatic that failure to proffer what the excluded evidence would have revealed precludes appellate consideration of the alleged error."" A.McD. v. State, 422 So.2d 336, 337 Fla. 3d DCA 1982) (citations omitted). Although we assume that the testimony would have been favorable to the defendant, we cannot speculate as to what that testimony would have been. See A.McD., 422 So.2d at 336. (""The bare question, `Have you ever been subject to any disciplinary investigations?' provides no insight as to its relevancy.""); Woodson *439 v. State, 483 So.2d 858, 859 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986) (""The witness' response was not `apparent' from the context of the question."")
The absence of proffer in the present case precludes our review of the alleged error. Because Fernandez does not contend that the answers sought from Officer Vermillion were also inherent in the questions asked, the absence of proffer precludes our review of that alleged error as well.
Second, no error occurred when John Kastrenakas, the former prosecutor on the case, was called by",616,11, the state as a rebuttal witness to impeach the

In summary I believe that over the next two to three weeks the market should rebound and produce profits for those dip buyers who braved the unknown. Once past the Libya crisis the next major pothole is the FOMC meeting on the 15th. ANY change in the statement to indicate the slightest deviation in the QE2 plan would be market negative.

Longer term the high oil prices are going to slow the recovery and make it very hard for the Fed to raise rates. They are stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place with inflation beginning to appear but oil, dollar and unemployment preventing them from changing their strategy. An old word is beginning to reappear in economic commentaries. That is stagflation. That is low growth coupled with rising inflation and according to Greenspan this is more insidious than any normal inflation cycle because normal FOMC tools to fight inflation cannot be used. The Fed is in trouble and this will eventually translate into a weaker market but I think it is still months away. Hedge funds anticipating this Fed problem will be our next challenge.

New Option Plays

Our Advantage

by James Brown

In addition to the new candidates listed tonight there were several stocks that caught my eye as potential bullish candidates. You may want to check them out or put them on your watch list. These are: ESI, CMG, DECK, AAPL, and AMGN.

On AAPL a move past $345.50 or $346.00 might be a bullish entry point. Meanwhile the trend in AMGN looks absolutely terrible but if it's going to see an oversold bounce then the $50 zone is where we should look.

Why We Like It:
Two days in a row traders bought the dip at $74.00. This looks like short-term support and we want to take advantage of the recent sell-off. Buy call positions now with a stop loss at $73.75. Our targets are $79.75 and $84.50. I'm suggesting we start this trade with small positions to limit our risk.

Open SMALL bullish positions now at current levels.

Why We Like It:
I consider this play somewhat aggressive. FFIV can be a very volatile stock and shares already produced a $5 bounce on Thursday. The 50-dma might be overhead resistance but shares managed to rally toward prior support and new resistance near $130 last time FFIV saw an oversold bounce. If we're lucky FFIV might see some minor profit taking tomorrow. I am suggesting new positions now but you might want to wait and cross your fingers hoping for a dip near $115 or $114. The recent lows were near $110. Our target is $129.00.

Saad Al-Hilli, 50, killed alongside wife, mother-in-law and a French cyclist



Former Iraqi dictator said to have deposited the sum in a Swiss bank account in the name of Mr Al-Hilli’s father

Mr Al-Hilli’s father Kadhim was once close to Saddam’s Ba’ath Party but later fled Iraq for Britain

Saddam Hussain gave £840,000 to the family of the British engineer who was murdered with his wife in the Alps, it was claimed last night.



The former Iraqi dictator is said to have deposited the sum in a Swiss bank account in the name of Saad Al-Hilli’s father.



The claim, which apparently originated with German intelligence, adds a sensational twist to the baffling case.



Scroll down for video

Cash deposit: Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, left, is said to have deposited £840,000 into the bank account of murdered Saad Al-Hilli's (pictured right) father Kadhim

Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy in Eastern France

Mr Al-Hilli, 50, from Surrey was killed along with his wife Iqbal, 47, his mother-in-law and a French cyclist last month in an attack that left his seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, badly injured, and her four-year-old sister Zeena deeply traumatised.

Mr Al-Hilli’s father Kadhim was once close to Saddam’s Ba’ath Party, but fell foul of the tyrant in the Seventies, and fled Iraq for Britain.



The scene of the September 5 massacre – an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy in Eastern France – is only an hour’s drive from Geneva where the money was deposited. Swiss prosecutor Dario Zanni believes the family may have been returning from there when ambushed.



Tragedy: How the killings were reported at the time of the massacre

It raises the possibility that Mr Al-Hilli had managed to gain access to the account, which is thought to have remained in his father’s name, and that this was known to his killer.



The story was reported in the respected French newspaper Le Monde. It said that a French police source had revealed that the money’s source had been discovered by German intelligence agency BND.



The agency’s operatives routinely monitored the flow of cash to and from Baghdad as Germany did more business with the Saddam regime than any other country.



An intelligence source in Munich said last night: ‘They know the money trail, and they know how to follow it. They have spent decades monitoring money transactions between the West and Iraq. The BND is the first port of call in such circumstances.’



The BND said they had no comment on the report, saying: ‘We do not comment on operations.’



The Le Monde story was published under the headline: ‘The potential links between the Al-Hillis and Saddam Hussein.’



It said: ‘According to a French police source, the German secret service informed the gendarmerie’s anti-terrorist branch that there were links between the Al-Hilli family and Saddam Hussein’s fortune.



‘The tensions began after Saad Al-Hilli’s father [Kadhim] was struck off the list of beneficiaries of the former Iraqi dictator.’



It has always been suggested that Kadhim’s multi-million pound legacy – he died last year – led to conflict between Saad, who lived in Claygate, Surrey, and his brother Zaid who lives in nearby Chessington. However Zaid strongly denies there was any such feud.

602,0,21955,0,"A normal ear transmits sounds as shown in FIG. 1 through the outer ear 101 to the tympanic membrane (eardrum) 102, which moves the bones of the middle ear 103 (malleus, incus, and stapes) that vibrate the oval window and round window openings of the cochlea 104. The cochlea 104 is a long narrow duct wound spirally about its axis for approximately two and a half turns. It includes an upper channel known as the scala vestibuli and a lower channel known as the scala tympani, which are connected by the cochlear duct. The cochlea 104 forms an upright spiraling cone with a center called the modiolar where the spiral ganglion cells of the acoustic nerve 113 reside. In response to received sounds transmitted by the middle ear 103, the fluid-filled cochlea 104 functions as a transducer to generate electric pulses which are transmitted to the cochlear nerve 113, and ultimately to the brain.
Hearing is impaired when there are problems in the ability to transduce external sounds into meaningful action potentials along the neural substrate of the cochlea 104. To improve impaired hearing, auditory prostheses have been developed. For example, when the impairment is related to operation of the middle ear 103, a conventional hearing aid may be used to provide acoustic-mechanical stimulation to the auditory system in the form of amplified sound. Or when the impairment is associated with the cochlea 104, a cochlear implant with an implanted stimulation electrode can electrically stimulate auditory nerve tissue with small currents delivered by multiple electrode contacts distributed along the electrode.
FIG. 1 also shows some components of a typical cochlear implant system which includes an external microphone that provides an audio signal input to an external signal processor 111 where various signal processing schemes can be implemented. The processed signal is then converted into a digital data format, such as a sequence of data frames, for transmission into the implant 108. Besides receiving the processed audio information, the implant 108 also performs additional signal processing such as error correction, pulse formation, etc., and produces a stimulation pattern (based on the extracted audio information) that is sent through an electrode lead 109 to an implanted electrode array 110. Typically, this electrode array 110 includes multiple electrodes on its surface that provide selective stimulation of the cochlea 104.
Existing cochlear implant systems need to deliver electrical power from outside the body through the skin to satisfy the power requirements of the implanted portion of the system. FIG. 1 shows a typical arrangement based on inductive coupling through the skin to transfer both the required electrical power and the processed audio information. As shown in FIG. 1, an external transmitter coil 107 (coupled to the external signal processor) is placed on the skin adjacent to a subcutaneous receiver coil in the implant 108. Often, a magnet in the external coil structure interacts with a corresponding magnet in the subcutaneous secondary coil structure. This arrangement inductively couples a radio frequency (rf) electrical signal to the receiver in the implant 108, which is able to extract from the rf signal both the audio information for the implanted portion of the system and a power component to power the implanted system.
In most prior systems, the external components generally have been held in separate housings so that the external transmitter coil 107 would not be in the same physical housing as the power source or the external signal processor. The various different physical components would generally be connected by hard wire, although some systems used wireless links between separate external components. A few systems have",737,11, been proposed in which all of the external components such as

Senior MPs have condemned as “unacceptable” a failure to publish the information, when the Commons is being asked to make its most momentous decision in decades.

They suspect “the existing analysis stands” – pointing to Treasury data, last year, that said the limited free trade deal Mr Johnson now plans with the EU will strip 6.7 per cent from GDP over 15 years.

No 10 denies that and suggested a fresh analysis would be published, but not until after the Brexit agreement is put before MPs in the rush to seal the deal.

Hilary Benn, the chairman of the Commons Brexit committee, demanded the “fullest assessment available”, suggesting the new deal was “even worse for the economy than Theresa May’s”.

The scrapped deal pointed to the entire UK remaining in the EU’s customs territory, but Mr Johnson’s offers that benefit to Northern Ireland only.

Dominic Raab came under fire after describing it as a “cracking deal” for Northern Ireland because it will keep “frictionless access to the single market” – which the rest of the UK will lose.

Catherine McKinnell, the interim chairwoman of the Treasury Committee, also demanded an updated economic assessment, saying: “It is unacceptable that the committee has not received this information from HM Treasury.

“It appears to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny. If the chancellor does not provide the committee with an update, we can only assume that the existing analysis stands.”

How can a pendulum have amplitude greater than $\pi$?

How can a pendulum have amplitude angle greater than $\pi$? I've been reading about phase plots, which are graphs of the $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ on the $y$ axis and $\theta$ on the $x$ axis, shown below.

I can understand that the curves are not perfect ovals because we cannot use the small angle approximation. I can also see that there is one curve in the right side's drawing which looks like a sine curve shape, but intersects the $x$ axis at $\pi$ and $-\pi$.
But how are the other curves i.e. the curve intersecting $y$ axis at +2 created? What equation gives that and how would the pendulum's motion look? How would such an equation be derived?
I have a pendulum equation $$\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2g}{l}(1-cos\theta_A)}$$
($\theta_A$ is amplitude)
I derived that with conservation of energy laws, like for a simple pendulum but I did not do the small angle approximation. I tried to put $\theta_A=\pi+1$ and I got a simple oval, not the pair of curves that is symmetric about the $x$ axis. I do not understand the math and notation being used in this question: What is the period of a physical pendulum without using small-angle approximation?
I'm confused.

A:

How are the other curves i.e. the curve intersecting y axis at +2 created?

The trick behind understanding that phase portrait is realizing that the 'amplitude' is not the fundamental quantity which acts as the difference between those lines.
The amplitude of a pendulum is usually considered to be the angle or displacement at which the velocity is zero, according to conventional intuition. But we see that the line you pointed out, the one with a maximum angular velocity of $2$, never reaches $\frac{d\theta}{dt}=0$, so a 'pendulum'described by that line won't have an amplitude according to our usual definition.
The solution? You need to think of maximum angular velocity as the fundamental quantity instead. For every pendulum shown by that phase portrait, the maximum angular velocity will be at the lowest point of the pendulum's trajectory. So each line in that phase portrait depicts a different trial with the same pendulum, except the angular velocity at that lowest point is different each time.
Think of performing an experiment to test the behavior of your pendulum for different amplitude angles, but each trial, instead of dropping the pendulum from a different position, you launch it from that same base point with a different velocity. And obviously $v=l\dot{\theta}$, where $\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\dot{\theta}$, so you'll be starting with different initial angular velocities.

What equation gives that and how would the pendulum's motion look?

Now let's consider you start the pendulum with a really high angular velocity... it'll eventually end up moving in a complete circle! When the pendulum reaches $\theta=\pi$, it'll still have some kinetic energy, and it'll descend on the opposite'side' of the pendulum's pivot.
When you're at the lowest point, you'll have the greatest velocity and hence the greatest angular velocity. As the height increases, the potential energy increases, hence the kinetic energy decreases and the angular velocity decreases. And thus you see a minimum, but nonzero angular velocity when $\theta=\pi$ according to the phase portrait.

A Pakistani man has vowed to flee Northern Ireland after he and a friend were injured in two racially motivated attacks — carried out within a matter of hours.

Less than 24 hours after attending an anti-racism rally in Belfast, friends Muhammad Khattak and Haroon Khan were assaulted and had their north Belfast home set upon by thugs yesterday.

In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Mr Khattak blamed the atmosphere stirred up by the fallout of an anti-Islamic sermon given by Pastor James McConnell, who was later backed by First Minister Peter Robinson.

In the six months since they moved into their home in Parkmount Street in the north of the city, they said they have suffered constant racial abuse.

Mr Khattak (24) said Peter Robinson's remarks about not trusting Muslim terrorists “cast suspicion over every Muslim”.

And he said the controversial words of Pastor McConnell gave his attackers “the licence” to do what they did.

“They have lit the fire in the forest and it is not going to stop,” he told the Belfast Telegraph.

The two men — one a university graduate, the other a trained lawyer — were first attacked in the early hours of yesterday morning when a bottle was hurled through a window. They were clearing up the remnants of the smashed window yesterday afternoon when they were attacked yet again.

This time they were approached by three men who racially taunted them before setting on them.

Both victims tried to escape into the house. However, the men chased them and Muhammad, who tried to lock himself into the bathroom for safety, was",356,11," badly beaten with a bottle.

611,0,23066,0,"Guido & Maurizio De Angelis

Guido and Maurizio De Angelis, also known as Oliver Onions, are a prolific duo of Italian musicians, multi-intstrumentalists, composers and singers, as well as television and film producers. They reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s both as composers (under their own names) and as performers (as Oliver Onions), mainly thanks to their scoring and theme song composing and performing for action/comedy films starring the popular duo of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, many of which became huge hits all across Europe, both cinematically and musically. After a period of retirement from the music business in the 1990s and early 2000s, during which they moved into television and film production through their own company (named after themselves), they had a musical comeback thanks to a one-off concert event in Budapest, Hungary, billed as Oliver Onions Reunion Live Budapest and organized by local promoter Gàbor Kóves mainly because of the duo's popularity in his homeland, itself due to the fact that Spencer & Hill films were hugely popular in the country during the Communist regime - and, according to Maurizio De Angelis's commentary on the show, still are. The event, testified by the 2017 release of a double CD/DVD box set, led to a series of other successful shows in Italy and Europe in the following years.

Beginnings

The brothers were born in Rocca di Papa, near Rome; Guido on 22 December 1944 and Maurizio on 22 February 1947. Their musical career started in 1963, when, after successfully releasing an LP, they became arrangers for RCA Italiana. Their success led to many more albums in which they composed and arranged the music and sang all the vocals.

Oliver Onions
The De Angelis brothers were among the most prolific Italian musicians of the 1970s. In fact, they were forced to use different names for many of their projects to avoid over-saturating the market: during their career, they were variously known as G&M Orchestra, Barqueros, Charango, Kathy and Gulliver, Hombres del Mar and Dilly Dilly. However, the name they came to be mostly identified with, and most popular, was suggested by their frequent collaborator and lyricist Susan Duncan-Smith, a British-born journalist who worked in RCA's foreign relationships department. She advised them that, although they did not run any risks in signing their early Spaghetti Western film score work under their own names (following in the footsteps of the popularity gained by fellow Italian Ennio Morricone in the same genre), their international credibility as singers of theme songs in English would be undermined if they did not perform under an English-language name. The brothers followed Duncan-Smith's advice and named themselves Oliver Onions after the homonymous British writer; the name was chosen mostly because it was easy to remember for both English speakers and non-speakers and because the two words are pronounced the same as they are written.  In Italy, they became best-known for writing and performing the theme song for Sergio Sollima's 1976 TV series Sandokan, based on novels by Emilio Salgari, which they also",681,11," wrote the music score for; the song, heard under"

### Detection of HuNoV in Outbreak-Derived Stool Samples {#s2d1}

The ELASA assay was used to assess the performance of select aptamer candidates for detection of HuNoV in outbreak-derived fecal suspensions. Specimens evaluated included those representing strains GI.1 (Norwalk), GI.6, GII.1, GII.2 (SMV), GII.3, GII.4, GII.7 and an untypable GII. Briefly, 100 µl of ten-fold serially diluted partially purified fecal suspensions were used to coat plates followed by incubation overnight at 4°C. After three washes with PBST, the ELASA assay was done as described above. PBS alone and fecal suspensions derived from uninfected individuals were used as negative controls. Due to limited availability of SMV VLPs, we used GII.4 (Houston) VLPs, which were also highly reactive to aptamer 25, as the positive control.

Gavin John Miller (born 4 January 1960) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s. An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative forward, he played the majority of his club football for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and is an Immortal of the club. He won two successive Dally M Player of the Year awards in 1988 and 1989.

At his peak Miller was regarded as the most dangerous attacking force in the NSWRL owing to his great ball skills, and his skill made Cronulla-Sutherland a formidable side after many years in the doldrums. Australian selectors during his brief but brilliant heyday were often criticised for ignoring Miller, but it is true he had failed to show his skills in a badly beaten New South Wales side during the 1989 State of Origin series.

Biography

Early days
Gavin Miller was born in Inverell, New South Wales. Before his late-1980s fame, Miller had already a long career in rugby league. He began playing for Goulburn as a  and was recommended to Western Suburbs in 1977. That year, he obtained a regular place in the team at the age of seventeen but was signed by Eastern Suburbs the following year. Miller did poorly for Easts in the following two years but Cronulla thought he had potential and signed him for 1980.

Still playing as a, Miller obtained a regular place in the Cronulla side and gradually showed he had exceptional ball skills as well as the ability to run which he had shown with Wests. Over his first four years at Cronulla he was moved into the forwards and did so well that by 1983 he was chosen to play for New South Wales. Miller did not fulfill expectations there and during the season was involved in a dispute with the Sharks' committee – he had said he would leave the financially-crippled club if it did not win the KB Cup. The Sharks failed to do this, and Miller was sacked at the beginning of October. That November Miller was signed by his former club Eastern Suburbs but played so poorly that he was relegated so low as third grade, while the Roosters won only five first-grade games out of 24.

Latter days
After leaving Easts, Miller went to England and joined Hull Kingston Rovers. In this role he developed his hitherto-dormant ball skills and was rewarded with many awards, including the Man of Steel award for the 1985–86 Rugby Football League season.

Miller played  in Hull Kingston Rovers’ 14–15 defeat by Castleford in the 1984 Challenge Cup Final during the 1984–85 season at Wembley Stadium, London, on Saturday 3 May 1986, in front of a crowd of 82,134.

Miller played, scored two tries, and was man of the match winning the White Rose Trophy in Hull Kingston Rovers’ 22–18 victory over Castleford in the 1985 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1985–86 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Sunday 27 October 1985.

Miller played  in Hull Kingston Rovers’ 12–0 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1984–85 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1984–85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull on Saturday 26 January 1985, and played  in the 8–11 defeat by Wigan in the 1985–86 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1985–86 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 11 January 1986.

Gavin Miller returned to Cronulla in 1986 as a much more mature player and after a slow start in his second stint with the Sharks, suddenly leapt to the top of the tree in 1988. His ability to consistently offload and send players into gaps (despite being small for a forward at around ) created so many tries that Cronulla won fifteen of their last seventeen home-and-away matches and claimed the club’s first minor premiership. Despite not playing for New South Wales against Queensland or against Great Britain, Miller's club form was so good that selectors could not ignore him for the Test against Papua New Guinea. In a world international rugby league record 70–8 win, Miller ""launched countless raid on the Kumuls' line"" and scored a try. He also played in the World Cup final against New Zealand, remarkably scoring a try once again, and in between was named as Man of the Match versus a ""Rest of the World"" team.

Compounding these issues, very few DApps are available for mobile devices, the major platform for any application. Given that there were over 2.4 billion worldwide smartphone users in 2017, it’s clear that efforts are needed to make DApps mobile.

Status hopes to achieve this by developing a mobile operating system for Ethereum that includes an open source messaging platform and mobile browser, enabling users to interact with DApps that run on the Ethereum Network. Status combines a secure messenger, web 3.0 browser and an Ethereum token wallet that will be available for iOS and Android devices. Additionally, the Status team is building out a Hardwallet which allows users to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions using near-field communication (NFC). Together, Status intends to build the first real mobile gateway to the decentralized web.

Interested in Status? Here’s a quick rundown of the project:

Platform & Development

In short, Status is developing a mobile interface that functionally acts as an Ethereum operating system, as each mobile device becomes a light client node on the Ethereum network. Through this interface, users are able to leverage a secure messaging system that uses a peer-to-peer protocol which doesn’t rely on centralized servers, giving users total control over personal data. With this system, users are also able to send payments and smart contracts within chats. However, Status is creating far more than a communication platform, as it is also developing a DApp browser, a wallet for ETH and ERC20 tokens, and a social network with hashtags and messenger stickers.

The integral element of the Status platform is its DApp directory, which will function much like the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. This directory will provide a gateway for users to navigate DApps by category and rating. Status has already listed a number of DApps that are available through its platform, including Gnosis, Aragon and uPort.

In addition to DApps, Status has emphasized decentralized chatbots as an additional set of listings in its store. Much like the DApps, these chatbots will be community created and have a variety of use cases.

Status has issued its own ERC-20 token SNT, which has a number of utilities across its platform, including:

In practice, Hansard reporting staff, clerks at the table, attendants and senators visiting the House of Representatives (and vice versa), are not normally regarded as strangers. Presiding Officers may also admit staff of members or senators to sit in the advisers’ box in the

respective chambers, but they are not permitted in the area on the floor of the chamber reserved for members.25

Today it seems odd that citizens would be considered strangers in their own parliament. Over time, the privilege of admission to the parliamentary chambers was gradually extended by each house to enable the visitors (including the public, media et cetera) to observe debate from special ‘strangers’ or public galleries, subject to some restrictions. Visitors can now

19. ibid. This later became standing order 314 and remained in place until 2004. A similar provision was included in the standing orders of the Senate. For example, see: Senate, Standing orders, with amendments and additions to 10 September 1909, Senate, SO 374.

621,0,20244,0,"President Franklin Roosevelt made it law in 1938, that any hourly worker had to be paid at least 25 cents an hour. It was revolutionary, and very few countries had anything like it.

Every few years, the federal minimum wage would go up, helping millions of Americans inch closer to a middle-class lifestyle. Something changed in the early 1970s, however, and since then, the minimum wage has fallen by around 25 percent.

Fast-forward to today. The minimum wage is currently $7.25. But in 1968, you’d make the equivalent of $10 an hour in today’s money. Basically the same group, but they have 30 percent less buying power.





On Tuesday night, during his State of the Union address, President Obama made the following statement:

“Even with the tax relief we’ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That’s wrong. Let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.”

His proposal would see the federal floor on hourly wages reach $9 in stages by the end of 2015. Tying the minimum wage to inflation would allow it to rise along with the cost of living. If enacted, the measure would boost the wages of about 15 million low-income workers, the White House estimated. The $9 minimum wage would be the highest in more than three decades, accounting for inflation, but still lower than the peaks reached in the 1960s and 1970s.

The White House said that the move would have profoundly positive effects for low-income families without unduly burdening businesses or raising the unemployment rate. It cited research showing no detectable employment losses from the kind of minimum wage increases we have seen in the United States.

But according to Fox News’ Bret Baier, and guest Nina Easton, the answer is a big “yes” – increasing the minimum wage will hurt employment and the economy. Anchoring Fox’s State of the Union coverage, Baier said that small businesses and Republicans typically push back on minimum wage hikes because of the old myth that “it will lead companies to cut back, lay people off, and not expand business.”

Nothing can be further from the truth.

In fact, studies show that raising the minimum wage does not result in higher unemployment.

In a March 2011 report, the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that raising the minimum wage has no “discernible impact” on employment. CEPR concluded that wage increases are more likely to result in more, rather than fewer, jobs:

“The results for fast food, food services, retail, and low-wage establishments in San Francisco and Santa Fe support the view that a citywide minimum wages can raise the earnings",605,11," of low-wage workers, without a discernible impact"
622,0,24713,0,"System z Software Pricing at IBM Enterprise 2014

DancingDinosaur must have sat through more of David Chase’s presentations on System z software pricing than anyone who doesn’t actually buy System z software. And still it seems impossibly complicated. The problem is the many different and changing circumstances under which a mainframe shop will use its System z. It speaks to IBM’s willingness to try to accommodate almost any use case for the mainframe while trying to be fair and still make a buck.

The last time DancingDinosaur wrote on mainframe software pricing it looked at IBM’s z/OS discounts for mobile transactions. It generated considerable interest. Well, there is more on mainframe software pricing at IBM Enterprise2014, Oct. 6-10 in Las Vegas. If you are paying workload pricing, you will want to check out these sessions:

IBM System z Software Pricing Overview by David Chase, who has spoken on this at numerous conferences and manages to make it understandable. This session introduces the software pricing options available for IBM’s zEnterprise and System z servers. It covers a variety of Monthly License Charge (MLC) metrics, including the newest ones: Advanced Workload License Charge (AWLC) and Advanced Entry Workload License Charge (AEWLC). It also introduces the IPLA “one-time charge” pricing and how it differs from MLC. Although the primary focus is on z/OS pricing, these pricing concepts also apply to z/VSE and z/TPF. If your organization is not taking advantage of these programs, you probably are over-paying for mainframe software.

Introduction to Sub-Capacity Pricing and Sub-Capacity Reporting Tool, again by David Chase. If your shop decides to adopt sub-capacity pricing for System z software, use of the Sub-Capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT) will be required whether you run z/OS, z/VSE and/or z/TPF. Attend this session to understand what the SCRT is, how it works, how to use it and how to interpret the output of the tool, the Sub-Capacity Report. This session also covers the planning steps for successful implementation of SCRT and discusses the end-to-end implementation process of collecting the required SMF data, running SCRT, reviewing the reports, and submitting them to IBM.

IBM System z Sub-Capacity and the SCRT Report by David Chase, of course. This session goes a step beyond the session above. Sub-capacity pricing for System z software is the way most customers achieve the optimal price performance available to them. But this means that the way your system is configured and used is very likely to have an impact upon the software charges you pay, and use of the Sub-Capacity Reporting Tool (SCRT) will be required. Attend this session to understand how SCRT works beyond the introductory level, how to use it, how to interpret the output of the tool (the Sub-Capacity Report), and most importantly, what options you have to tune your system to influence your monthly software charges.

628,0,27482,2050," Muslims search for an alternative vision of the world. It is not surprising that many wannabe jihadis are either converts to Islam, or Muslims who discovered their faith only relatively late. In both cases, disenchantment with what else is on offer has led them to the black and white moral code that is Islamism. It is not, in other words, a question of being ‘groomed’ or ‘indoctrinated’ but of losing faith in mainstream moral frameworks and searching for an alternative.

.

And, like Roy, I also suggest that the relationship between European jihadis and Islam is not as straightforward as many assume:

While the social and political changes of which I have spoken – the fragmentation of society, the erosion of trust in mainstream institutions, the breakdown of old social mechanisms, the retreat of the left, the rise of identity politics, and so on – have shaped the ways in which many social groups look upon themselves, there is, at the same time, something highly distinctive about the identity in which Islamist cloak themselves.

.

For a start, Islam is a global religion. It allows Islamist identity to be both intensely parochial and seemingly universal, linking Muslims to struggles across the world, from Afghanistan to Chechnya to Palestine, and providing the illusion of being part of a global movement. Islamism provides also the illusion of a struggle for a better world. In an age in which traditional anti-imperialist movements have faded, and belief in an alternative to capitalism dissolved, Islamism seems to provide the possibility of both an alternative to capitalist society and of a struggle against an immoral system.

.

And yet, most homegrown wannabe jihadis possess a peculiar relationship with Islam. They are, in many ways, as estranged from Muslim communities as they are from wider Western society. Most detest the mores and traditions of their parents, have little time for mainstream forms of Islam, and cut themselves",407,11," off from traditional community institutions…

The content present in the tube was homogenized, and from this three aliquots were taken of 10 μL, distributed in glass plate of 7.5 × 2.5 cm. The larvae were counted using a stereomicroscope at increase of 25× \[[@CR1]\].

The proteolytic activity was measured by the method of Soares and colleagues \[[@CR7]\]. A standard curve of tyrosine was built for the quantification of enzyme activity. One unit of protease was defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1.0 μg of tyrosine per minute under the assay conditions.

A zymogram with co-polymerized casein in an acrylamide gel \[[@CR10]\] as substrate (casein-SDS-PAGE) was performed as described by Soares and colleagues \[[@CR7]\]. The proteolytic activity was observed by the formation of white halos. The halos of digestion were excised and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) in order to verify the presence of enzymes.

An *in vitro* assay was conducted to evaluate the nematicidal action of the proteases of *A. sinensis* (SF53) produced in liquid medium on *A. vasorum* L~1~ following the methodology of Soares and colleagues \[[@CR8]\]. Two groups were formed in sterile tubes, a treated group containing the crude proteases and a control group (without enzyme), which were then incubated at 26°C in the dark for 24 h. A total of 100 *A. vasorum* L~1~ were poured into sterile tubes containing the crude enzyme. The control group consisted of only 100 *A. vasorum* L~1~ in distilled water. Six replicates were performed for each group. After 24 h, the number of *A. vasorum* L~1~ present in each tube of the treated and control groups was counted.

The data obtained in this experiment were interpreted by analysis of variance in significance levels of 1 and 5% probability. The efficiency of L~1~ predation compared to control was assessed by the Tukey test at 1% probability \[[@CR11]\]. Subsequently, the percentage reduction of average larvae (L~1~) was calculated according to the following equation:

Results and discussion {#Sec4}
----------------------

It was observed that the fungus *A. sinensis* (SF53) has produced proteases, when grown in an inducer liquid medium. However, proteolytic activity (15.78 U/mL) was lower than that obtained when the same fungus was grown on solid culture medium (38.0 U/mL) \[[@CR7]\]. Moreover, a single halo was observed at the beginning of digestion of the gel, suggesting that the three proteases of SF53 are produced in an enzymatic complex of large molecular weight (Figure [1](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}). When grown on solid culture medium, three evident halos were observed in the zymogram of the same fungus \[[@CR7]\]. Probably this difference is due to the enzymatic extraction by stirring, a more brute technique, in the case of solid medium, which may have ruptured the enzymatic complex, ""releasing"" each protease.Figure 1**Zymogram of the proteases of** ***Arthrobotrys sinensis*** **(SF53) in liquid medium",823,11,.** Zymogram of the proteases produced by

These findings have led to the investigation of small molecule inhibitors of ribosomal transcription as potential chemotherapeutic agents. Inhibition of the RPI pre-initiation factor SL1/TIF1B \[[@R55]\] or induced proteasome degradation of the RPI large subunit \[[@R56]\] both lead to arrest of rRNA synthesis and mediate cell death dependent on p53 function. However, the key to successful cancer therapy remains the selective targeting of cancer cells, and since p53 is often inactivated in human cancers, therapies that depend on functional p53 have limited application. Our data now suggest that inhibition the RPI basal transcription factor UBF (Upstream Binding Factor) represents a particularly valuable p53-independent target for cancer therapy.

Here we show that displacement of UBF and ablation of rRNA synthesis are very early effects of cisplatin treatment, and that in the absence of cisplatin, elimination of UBF protein is sufficient to induce fully penetrant apoptotic cell death. Using cell cultures conditional for UBF expression, we find that complete loss of ribosome biogenesis induces synchronous and fully penetrant, p53-independent cell death by apoptosis specifically in cells transformed by known oncogenes. The data argue that a major factor in the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and similar drugs is their ability to inhibit the function of UBF. This suggests that UBF itself represents a preferred target for anticancer drug development.

RESULTS {#s2}
=======

Previous data has clearly indicated that cisplatin treatment of human cells leads to a partial or full displacement of human UBF and inhibition of rRNA synthesis \[[@R14], [@R15], [@R17], [@R18]\]. However, to what extent this plays a role in the selective cytotoxicity of cisplatin is not known. When the Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) derived cell line NIH3T3 was treated for 4 h with 30 μM cisplatin, a concentration calculated to be equivalent to the dose commonly used in therapy (e.g see \[[@R57], [@R58]\]), a large proportion of endogenous UBF was displaced from nucleoli and scattered throughout the nucleus at a large number of foci ([Figure S1](#SD1){ref-type=""supplementary-material""}). These foci were devoid of the other nucleolar proteins fibrillarin and RPI (data not shown), which remained together in dense nuclear bodies somewhat similar to the nucleolar precursor bodies forming on conditional deletion of the *Ubf* gene \[[@R11]\].

635,0,23227,0,"The first month of play for the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2009-2010 season ended exactly how it began: with a win over the Carolina Hurricanes. On Friday, October 2nd, the Flyers came in to the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina and blanked the home-standing Hurricanes, 2-0 behind Ray Emery’s first shutout as a Flyer. Yesterday, the Flyers rode a fight filled Halloween-day contest to a 6-1 decision over those same Hurricanes, with Ray Emery making 30+ saves in the victory. However, in a month that began and ended with a win, the games that fell in between cast a cloud over the Flyers’ overall performance during the season’s first 30 days of play.

Ray Emery got his 6th win of the season yesterday

Just to refresh: after 11 games in 2009, the Flyers are a sub-par 6-4-1, good for 13 points. The Flyers are currently 4th place in the Atlantic Division, with only the New York Islanders behind the Orange and Black. Overall in the Eastern Conference, the Flyers are holding on to the 8th and final playoff spot, something that at this point means a first round playoff date with the defending Champion Pittsburgh Penguins. So, what went wrong this month, and what went right? Who shined? Who struggled? What should we look forward to in November? Don’t worry, I’ve got you covered.

What went right in October?

The truth? Not much. The scoring has been balanced, but it hasn’t been as high as last season. Captain Mike Richards leads the way for the Orange and Black, tallying 12 points (6 G, 6 A) in 11 games. Obviously it’s not horrible, and the Flyers do have four players (Richards, Carter, Carle, JVR) who are in the double digit point total already. However, the fact is that the Flyers offensive power was supposed to be a lot stronger. As far as the team as a whole is concerned, the main word to characterize the Flyers is “Inconsistent”. The Orange and Black have flip-flopped wins and losses far too often in the early stages of the season and need to improve upon that coming into November. Perhaps not taking every other game for granted would be a nice start.

What went wrong in October?

Too much. Most notably: injuries and defensive play. The Flyers, as has become the all too uncomfortable scenario in early season play, have been hit by the injury bug plenty of time so far this season. Currently, Simon Gagne has not one, but two hernias and his return is up in the air. Danny Briere left practice friday with a slight groin pull and missed yesterday’s contest against Carolina. Those two are the big highlights to what has been an unhealthy month for the Orange and Black. Defensively, the entire group has been a disappointment. The Flyers are -2 collectively as a unit, with Chris Pronger and Matt Carle being the only players on the positive side. With the talent that the Flyers blue-line has, it’s not acceptable to post such number as a unit.

Who shined in October?

Carle's first month was Norris-worthy

Pretty easy answer here. Matt Carle had a tremendous October, posting 2 goals and 10 assists in 11 games, and he is currently tied with Mike Richards for the title of leading scorer on the Flyers. He’s reaped the benefits of playing alongside a future Hall of Famer in Pronger and has shined at both ends of the rink. The Flyers helped his cause tremendously when they opted to send Randy Jones down to the Phantoms (who has since been claimed off waivers by Los Angeles), because it solidified a permanent spot in the Flyers’ line-up. Carle hasn’t looked back since. Hopefully the young gun from the University of Denver can keep it going for the rest of the season. If he has a repeat of October next month, it would be wise to assume a potential All-Star selection may be in his future.

Who struggled in October?

Giroux was atrocious in October

I take personal offense to Claude Giroux’s performance in the first month of the season. I selected him as the Flyers breakout offensive player in my season preview, and thus far #28 has been anything but. In 11 games, Giroux – who was counted on to find the back of the net a plethora of times this season – has only scored once. He only has three assists. In watching him play, it’s very easy to notice that Giroux is taking himself for granted. He knows he’s talented, but he’s not playing with anything to prove like he did in the stretch run last season. If and when",1023,11, Giroux starts to notice that it takes work to be

""You may go your own way,"" said the mother, not quite pleasantly.
""Young folks are that headstrong!  I can't look for my children to be
better than other folks'.  If they are as good, it's as much as one need
expect in this world.""

Flemild had been busily tying on a red hood while her mother spoke, and
signing to her little sister to do the same.  Then the elder girl took
from a corner, where it hung on a hook, a budget or pail of boiled
leather, a material then much used for many household vessels now made
of wood or metal: and the girls went out into the narrow street.

The street was called Kepeharme Lane, and the city was Oxford.  This
lane ran, in old diction, from the Little Bayly to Fish Street--in
modern language, from New Inn Hall Street to Saint Aldate's, slightly
south of what is now Queen Street, and was then known as the Great
Bayly.  The girls turned their backs on Saint Aldate's, and went
westwards, taking the way towards the Castle, which in 1159 was not a
ruined fortress, but an aristocratic mansion, wherein the great De Veres
held almost royal state.

""Why don't you like Saint Martin's Well, Flemild?"" demanded the child,
with childish curiosity.

""Oh, for lots of reasons,"" answered her sister evasively.

""Tell me one or two.""

""Well, there is always a crowd there towards evening.  Then, very often,
there are ragamuffins on Penniless Bench [Note 2] that one does not want
to come too near.  Then--don't you see, we have to pass the Jewry?""

""What would they do to us?"" asked the child.

""Don't talk about it!"" returned her sister, with a shudder.  ""Don't you
know, Derette, the Jews are very, very wicked people?  Hasn't Mother
told you so many a time?  Never you go near them--now, mind!""

""Are they worse than we are?""

Flemild's conscience pricked her a little as she replied, ""Of course
they are.  Don't you know they crucified our Lord?""

""What, these Jews?"" asked Derette with open eyes.  ""Old Aaron, and
Benefei at the corner, and Jurnet the fletcher, and--O Flemild, not,
surely not Countess and Regina?  They look so nice and kind, I'm sure
they never could do any thing like that!""

""No, child, not these people, of course.  Why, it was hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.  But these are just as bad--every one of them.
They would do it again if they had the chance.""

""Countess wouldn't, _I_ know,"" persisted the little one.  ""Why, Flemild,
only last week, she caught pussy for me, and gave her to me, and she
smiled so prettily.  I liked her.  If Mother hadn't said I must never
speak to any of them, I'd have had a chat with her; but of course I
couldn't, then, so I only smiled back again, and nodded for `thank
you.'""

""Derette!""  There was genuine terror in the tone of the elder sister.
""Don't you know those people are all wicked witches?  Regular black
witches, in league with the Devil.  There isn't one of them would not

639,0,20567,0,"The 5 Best Low-Glycemic Index Carbs to Eat Before a Race

By Donna P. Feldman, MS, RDN | For Active.com

One study, via a number of blood tests, compared the effects of moderate-GI rolled oats, high-GI puffed rice or a control (plain water) on endurance athletes. The subjects ate a meal with 75 grams of carbohydrate from the test food 45 minutes before performing a cycling exercise to exhaustion. The lower-GI oats resulted in lower glucose at the start of exercise, but sustained higher glucose throughout the cycling exercise, indicating more glucose available to the muscles when it counted. Time to exhaustion was longer on the rolled-oats meal compared to the high-GI rice, or the control.

What can you eat to take advantage of the low-GI effect? Here are some important considerations for choosing lower GI foods:

GI scoring is not at all complete. It's an expensive process, and so far has been done mostly with simple, unprocessed foods. Mixed foods, from commercial products to home recipes, have not been tested.

Most sports products—gels, blocks, shots, bars, drinks—are intended for use during activity. The carbohydrate energy will be more readily available. While this means the products are likely high GI, it's impossible to know for sure, unless they've officially been assessed for a GI score. Foods tested by the Glycemic Index Foundation will have a low GI icon. This is a voluntary program, and food companies may not bother paying for this service.

The GI score depends on eating 50 grams of carbs from the food. If you eat less of that food, glucose won't increase as much. You may always have good results eating a supposedly high-GI food because you eat less of it and combine it with moderate GI foods. The end result is a moderate GI effect.

The foods an athlete tolerates or likes, as well as the amounts, are specific to the individual. One athlete's low-GI oatmeal may not sit well with another athlete. Some people may feel they benefit from some high-GI carbs, or more or less fat or protein.

The research on glycemic index and sports performance is incomplete. While there is evidence of a benefit from moderate-GI foods before an event, more research is needed to identify specific foods that give the best results for fuel availability.

Orange juice: might be hard on your stomach without some food to go along with it, such as toast.

Certain fruits like grapes, mango, banana and kiwi.

Whole wheat bread: have some toast with your orange juice.

Corn tortillas: make a small soft taco with beans and a dash of cheese.

Dark chocolate: while plain dark chocolate isn't likely to be something an athlete eats by itself before an event, it can be a flavoring in other foods. The Glycemic Index Foundation lists plenty of chocolate products as moderate GI, including chocolate-flavored soy milk, chocolate muffins and chocolate ice cream. And there's the moderate-GI Snickers bars. Obviously, these types of foods will be a very individual choice.

Energy bars: even without official GI testing, bars that have some protein and fat content, with a minimum of added sugar are likely moderate GI. Bars that are primarily puffed cereal held together with sugar syrup, frosting and candy bits are likely high GI. Stick to oat and whole grain-based bars with dried fruit and nuts.

The results of study 1 indicated that the representation of gender involved the perceptual simulation of vertical space. If the gender-linked spatial height (e.g., male face was presented on the top of screen) was consistent with the actual physical feature of gender, gender categorization was facilitated. If gender and spatial height were incongruent, gender categorization was degraded.

Study 2 {#s3}
=======

In addition to vertical height, size is also a salient physical difference between males and females. We conducted study 2 to determine if the representation and processing of gender involves the perceptual simulation of spatial size. We predicted that male names would be judged faster if they were presented in bigger font size, whereas female names would be judged faster if they were presented in smaller font size.

646,0,20663,0,"Today, the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) released a report outlining the opportunity costs of socialism on the macro economy, including standards of living, and the impact on the Federal budget. Below is the executive summary. Read the full report here.

Coincident with the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx’s birth, socialism is making a comeback in American political discourse. Detailed policy proposals from self-declared socialists are gaining support in Congress and among much of the electorate.

It is unclear, of course, exactly what a typical voter has in mind when he or she thinks of “socialism.” But economists generally agree about how to define socialism, and they have devoted enormous time and resources to studying its costs and benefits. With an eye on this broad body of literature, this report discusses socialism’s historic visions and intents, its economic features, its impact on economic performance, and its relationship with recent policy proposals in the United States.

We find that historical proponents of socialist policies and those in the contemporary United States share some of their visions and intents. They both characterize the distribution of income in market economies as the unjust result of “exploitation,” which should be rectified by extensive state control. The proposed solutions include single-payer systems, high tax rates (“from each according to his ability”), and public policies that hand out much of the Nation’s goods and services “free” of charge (“to each according to his needs”). Where they differ is that contemporary democratic socialists denounce state brutality and would allow individuals to privately own the means of production in many industries.

In assessing the effects of socialist policies, it is important to recognize that they provide little material incentive for production and innovation and, by distributing goods and services for “free,” prevent prices from revealing economically important information about costs and consumer needs and wants. To this end, as the then–prime minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher (1976), once argued, “Socialist governments... always run out of other people’s money,” and thus the way to prosperity is for the state to give “the people more choice to spend their own money in their own way.”

Whether socialism delivers on its appealing promises is an empirical question. We begin our investigation by looking closely at the most highly socialist cases, which are typically agricultural economies, such as Maoist China, Cuba, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Their nondemocratic governments seized control of farming, promising to make food more abundant. The result was substantially less food production and tens of millions of deaths by starvation. Even if highly socialist policies are peacefully implemented under the auspices of democracy, the fundamental incentive distortions and information problems created by large state organizations and the centralized control of resources are also present in industrialized countries, as is currently the case in Venezuela. Lessons from poorly performing agricultural economies under socialist regimes carry over to government takeovers of other modern industries: They produce less rather than more.

These countries are examples of a more general pattern of socialism’s negative output effects. Such outcomes have also been observed in cross-country studies of the effect of greater economic freedom—quantified as an",678,11," index of taxation and public spending, the extent of state"
647,0,21546,1025," reported in the eligible Cochrane review. For consistency we focused on mortality, the most serious outcome.

We searched the Cochrane database of systematic reviews (last update 27 August 2012) using terms for mortality (death OR mortality OR survival) in the title, abstract, or keywords. The reviews included in this database are considered to be thorough in searching for eligible studies.[@ref23] We excluded protocols and reviews that had been withdrawn, had no statistical synthesis on mortality, and had no country information of individual trials. Only reviews including randomised and pseudorandomised trials were eligible. Whenever a systematic review contained two or more different pertinent intervention comparisons we considered these separately.

We also excluded reviews in which all the randomised trials from less developed or more developed countries had zero deaths. Multicentre international trials were eligible if all the countries were either less developed or more developed.

Data extraction
---------------

From each eligible trial we extracted the publication year, country of origin, number of participants, and number of deaths in each trial arm. We selected deaths from all causes; if, however, there were no data for all cause mortality we used cause specific mortality. Whenever there were several forest plots on mortality, we selected the one that reported overall data rather than subgroups. Whenever separate forest plots pertained to non-overlapping events for the same participants (for example, stillbirths and neonatal deaths), we selected whichever analysis included more deaths. For many conditions deaths are uncommon, conferring low power to show differences in effect sizes for mortality. Therefore, for each eligible topic we also examined separately the meta-analysis on the primary binary outcome (mortality or other). Whenever several eligible binary outcomes existed, we selected whichever had the largest number of studies regardless of whether this was mortality. Only meta-analyses with data from one or more trials from a less developed country and one or more trials from a more developed country were eligible. For each eligible trial we recorded the publication year, country, characteristics of participants, and events per arm.

Two investigators (OAP, DGCI) independently extracted data. Any disagreements were resolved after discussion with the third investigator (JPAI).

Statistical analysis
--------------------

As a metric of relative risk, we used the odds ratio for our analyses when this could be estimated from available 2×2 tabular data for each trial. When this estimation was not possible we used the hazard ratio or risk ratio estimates as provided in the forest plots. Effect estimates for each trial were coined consistently to represent the odds of death or unfavourable primary outcome for the experimental (newer) intervention versus control. When survival or favourable primary outcomes were reported, we took the complementary mortality or unfavourable",560,11," primary outcome event counts.

It wasn’t until I started being open and honest about my own journey that I realized just how misconstrued the term “self-love” is. At first I was really thrown off by some of the reactions I encountered, to the point where I even started to second guess myself and my decisions, but eventually I learned to stop taking offense. I came to the conclusion that any benighted response I was met with was just a lack of understanding on the person’s part and I have since done my best to educate, whenever necessary, on the true motivations behind a self-love journey.

To this day, I get a lot of comments like “What does that even mean?” and “I don’t really get what you’re trying to do here” and “Are you just tired of dating or something?” (Um, yeah, but that’s not the point).

649,0,21016,2050," court concluded that Mr. Rhodes’s one-year

window to seek federal habeas relief commenced on August 4, 2015, when the

Wyoming Supreme Court denied his Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis. Three-

hundred and fifty-two days later, on July 21, 2016, Mr. Rhodes filed his request for

post-conviction relief with the state trial court. That filing, the federal district court

reasoned, tolled Mr. Rhodes’s limitations period with thirteen days to go. See

§ 2244(d)(2). The suspension of AEDPA’s limitations period continued during the

pendency of Mr. Rhodes’s appeal of the state trial court’s order to the Wyoming

Supreme Court. Id. But the limitations period restarted when, on February 28, 2017,

the Wyoming Supreme Court denied Mr. Rhodes relief for the second and final time.

Thus, according to the district court’s calculations, Mr. Rhodes needed to file his

                                             3
federal habeas petition within the next thirteen days—that is, on or before March 13,

2017. Because Mr. Rhodes’s petition was not filed until May of 2017, the district

court concluded it was time-barred pursuant to § 2244(d)(1)(A) and (d)(2).

      Next, the district court concluded that §§ 2244(d)(1)(B)–(D) did not save Mr.

Rhodes’s petition. As to § 2244(d)(1)(B), it acknowledged Mr. Rhodes’s argument

that he was “blocked” from getting the entire record of his trial until after the one-

year timeframe had expired, but it concluded Mr. Rhodes identified no impediment

created by state action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States

that could extend the accrual date. The district court also held that Mr. Rhodes failed

to indicate any possible prejudice he may have suffered by not having the trial

transcript sooner. As to § 2244(d)(1)(C), the district court held it inapplicable

because Mr. Rhodes had not cited any newly recognized, and retroactively applied,

constitutional right. As to § 2244(d)(1)(D), the district court again considered Mr.

Rhodes’s allegation that Wyoming delayed in providing him a transcript of the trial

court proceedings. It concluded that such a delay is “not the type of factual predicate

necessary to justify application” of § 2244(d)(1)(D) and, besides, the “factual” basis

for Mr. Rhodes’s asserted grounds for habeas relief, i.e., ineffective assistance of

counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and judicial misconduct, was clearly known to

him long before he physically received the trial court hearing transcript. Finally, the

district court held that Mr. Rhodes has not supported any actual innocence exception.

Background {#Sec2}
----------

*Angiostrongylus vasorum* (Baillet, 1866) Kamensky, 1905, is a protostrongylidae parasite nematode of domestic dogs and wild canids, which causes angiostrongylosis, disease important in public health. In this aspect, stands out the presence of free larvae in the environment and thus the possibility of human infection, since other parasites of the genus *Angiostrongylus* are proven zoonotic. In dogs, the disease is associated with the occurrence of cough, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, weight loss, vomiting, neurological signs, heart failure and death. The infection of dog may occur when ingesting 1) infected paratenic hosts, such as frogs and small mammals, 2) infected intermediate hosts (molluscs) of the genera *Biomphalaria* and *Physa* and among others, 3) or food or water contaminated with free infective larvae in the environment \[[@CR1], [@CR2]\].

Despite some successful cases, currently the control of this parasite has been associated with use of anthelmintics that although routinely used, do not act very well on the parasite in the definitive host \[[@CR3]\]. Moreover, angiostrongylosis rarely develops acutely and in this sense the clinical signs are perceived later, allowing a continuous environmental dispersion of the parasite through the feces of infected dogs. Some authors have shown that the use of complementary measures to combat helminthoses that complete their development in the environment can be used as tools of control \[[@CR4], [@CR5]\]. Thus, the use of nematophagous fungi is cited here. These organisms use mechanical devices such as modified hyphae (traps) and enzymatic artifices to overcome the nematode larvae (production of hydrolytic enzymes, especially proteases) \[[@CR6]\].

According to Soares and colleagues \[[@CR5]\], one of the promising genera of nematophagous fungi is *Monacrosporium*. Those authors have developed some works that demonstrate their nematicidal activity. In this context, in a recent study, Soares and colleagues \[[@CR7]\] showed that the predatory nematophagous fungus *Monacrosporium sinense* (SF53) produces three proteases with nematicidal activity when grown on solid media culture. It is suggested that these extracellular proteases are important at various stages of infection, such as release of nutrients for growth of the microorganism penetration of the cuticle and digestion of the host tissue. However, the production of an enzymatic complex by this fungus remains unclear.

Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the production of proteases from nematophagous fungus *Arthrobotrys sinensis* in liquid medium and its nematicidal activity on first stage larvae of *A. vasorum*.

Materials {#Sec3}
---------

The nematophagous fungus *A. sinensis*, isolate SF53, was used for the production of proteases in liquid medium. This isolate is derived from Brazilian soil and has been kept under laboratory conditions through continuous transfer to solid medium. The fungus was cultivated for 10 days in the dark. Then fungal mycelia were transferred to previously autoclaved flasks containing 50 ml of liquid medium composed of (in grams per liter): glucose, 10; yeast extract, 10; K~2~HPO~4~, 5; MgSO~4~, 0.10; ZnSO~4~, 0.005; FeSO~4~, 0.001; CuSO~4~, 0.0005. The inoculum has grown in shaken flasks at 120 × g. After 6 days, proteases were obtained in its crude form, by filtration using Whatman no.1 filter paper, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 10 × g and 4°C. The supernatant (crude proteases) was used in the subsequent assays \[[@CR8]\].

In this study, the strain of *A. vasorum* used has been maintained by the Department of Parasitology, Federal University of Minas Gerais and it is originated from naturally infected dogs, from the city of Caratinga, Minas Gerais \[[@CR9]\]. For its obtaining, faeces of infected dogs were collected and placed in a modified Baermann apparatus for the recovery of L~1~. The fa",1011,11,eces remained in the apparatus for 12 hours.

Twenty-two year-old to be sentenced next month

A man who shot and stabbed another man in the midst of a drug deal is looking at some major time behind bars.

Just how long James Shawn Halleran will be in jail will be decided by a judge next month.

During Halleran’s sentencing hearing at provincial court in St. John’s Thursday, the Crown requested that the 22-year-old get an eight-year prison term.

Halleran’s lawyer suggested a jail sentence of four to five years.

Judge Lori Marshall will make her final determination Jan. 9.

Halleran and a 17-year-old were arrested following an incident that happened in the afternoon of Oct. 26, 2011.

According to the agreed statement of facts, Halleran and the teen were at

231A Southside Rd. — where Halleran’s uncle lived — to meet a drug dealer, who was to sell them five pounds of marijuana.

When the dealer showed up, the teen had a small, cardboard box on the table, which he said contained $14,500. A disagreement arose as to the price of the marijuana. The teen said, “Don’t worry. You’re not getting any money'

Halleran, who had not been in the room, suddenly appeared, masked and holding a.22-calibre rifle. The drug dealer quickly tried to bag his marijuana, but Halleran hit him in the head with the gun. That sparked a fracas that saw the teen order Halleran to shoot the 40-year-old man. As all three were struggling, Halleran fired the gun and hit the man in the leg.

As Halleran was trying to reload the gun, the teen and the man were struggling on the floor. The teen asked Halleran to shoot the man again.

The man managed to grab the gun. It was then Halleran and the teen stabbed the man several times.

Halleran went back into the back room and came out with another long gun. He wasn’t wearing a mask this time.

The man — who was rescued by his two friends who rushed into the house — was admitted to hospital in critical condition with multiple stab wounds to his upper torso and a gunshot wound to his left leg.

He needed surgery to repair an aortic bleed caused by the stabbing. The gunshot caused a fracture to one of the man’s leg bones. He was discharged from hospital in November 2011.

Halleran was arrested Nov. 3, 2011, and was originally denied bail. He applied for a bail review and was eventually released.

Antes de acceder a sus cajas de seguridad el gerente de la sucursal les acercó un formulario impreso en el que se les pedía que autorizaban a “autoridad competente” a realizar ""violentaciones"" el contenido de sus cajas.

Como era previsible esto disparó hasta el cielo los temores de una requisa del Gobierno de las cajas de seguridad en busca de dólares, rumor que ante cada crisis financiera que enfrenta el kirchnerismo, vuelve a aparecer.

La novedad es que esta vez no fue un rumor, LPO accedió en exclusiva al formulario que el banco pidió a sus clientes firmar como exigencia previa para que accedan a las cajas.

“El solicitante toma conocimiento y acepta, que el BANCO permitirá el ingreso al recinto de cajas de seguridad, de autoridades competentes, con facultades suficientes para llevar a cabo violentaciones y/u otras diligencias relacionadas con la caja, que hayan sido ordenadas por autoridad competente. Dichas actividades se realizarán sin necesidad de la presencia y/o aviso del Solicitante”, sostiene el párrafo más inquietante de la autorización que hacían firmar a los clientes del HSBC antes de ingresar a sus cajas de seguridad.

“Esto es una locura ¿Quién es la autoridad competente?”, se indignaron los clientes a los que le pedían firmar una autorización que sencillamente derriba el derecho de propiedad.

El gerente sólo murmuraba excusas. Ante lo cual muchos de los presentes optaron por no firmar el documento e impedidos de ingresar a sus cajas, se retiraron de la sucursal.

Desde el Banco Central afirmaron a LPO que se trata de un formulario de norma, que no responde a ninguna circular nueva de la institución. Y agregaron que ""autoridad competente"" debe leerse como autoridad judicial, aunque el texto no lo especifica.



Incluso las fuentes del Central aclararon que el Banco Central no tiene autoridad para normar sobra las cajas de seguridad porque se entiende que se trata de un ""acuerdo entre privados"". O lo sumo, la autoridad monetaria podría dictaminar en que lugar ubicarlas por consideraciones de seguridad, pero no mucho más, agregaron.

Lo extraño es que en el HSBC recién ahora apareció y sobre todo que como queda claro en su encabezado se trata de un ""complemento"" del contrato firmado oportunamente.

El formulario que parece emanado de algún organismo gubernamental porque apela al genérico ""BANCO"", es decir que podría ser repartido rápidamente a cualquier institución bancaria, comienza sosteniendo que "" El presente complementa la solicitud o contrato de locación cajas de seguridad suscripto oportunamente, con el objeto de incorporar al mismo las siguientes cláusulas"".

The Emerald Cup organizer and industry icon Tim Blake, far left, talks back to heckler Kevin Saunders during a legalization debate Saturday.

The likelihood of California cannabis legalization increased dramatically Saturday night when the leading initiative — the Adult Use of Marijuana Act — garnered crucial endorsements from community leader Tim Blake, organizer of the world's biggest outdoor organic cannabis competition, The Emerald Cup.“You know what, I’m going to endorse this thing,” Blake said, to a mix of applause and outrage among activists assembled for a legalization debate at the Cup in Sonoma County.A united effort to legalize adult use cannabis in California has a 55-percent chance to succeed in 2016, experts conclude, while an effort fractured by in-fighting would almost certainly fail.AUMA's official proponents are noted physician Donald Lyman and environmentalist Michael Sutton, and the proposal is rapidly gaining momentum.Leading reform groups Marijuana Policy Project, Drug Policy Alliance, and the California Cannabis Industry Association have endorsed the measure.Last week, rival group ReformCA withdrew from the race, with at least six ReformCA board members endorsing AUMA.One of the cultivation’s community’s biggest leaders, Blake, joined them Saturday — stating that AUMA is the only chance for progress in 2016. No other group has the funds or coalition to run a winning initiative in 2016, he said. Ten groups have filed initiatives.“I’m for an initiative where we should get more, but … you’re still dealing with the cops and the counties that want to opt in and out, the Chambers of Commerce, and all those people and they’re",339,11," not going to bend,” he said.�"

This function performs a simulation-based test for over/underdispersion
}
\details{
The function implements two tests, depending on whether it is applied on a simulation with refit = F, or refit = T.

If refit = F, the function tests the sd of the data against the sd of the simulated data.

If refit = T, the function compares the approximate deviance (via squared pearson residuals) with the same quantity from the models refitted with simulated data. Applying this is much slower than the previous alternative. Given the computational cost, I would suggest that most users will be satisfied with the standard dispersion test.
}
\note{
The results of the dispersion test can can differ depending on whether it is evaluated on conditional (= conditional on fitted random effects) or unconditional (= REs are re-simulated) simulations. You can change between conditional or unconditional simulations in  \code{\link{simulateResiduals}} if this is supported by the regression package that you use. The default in DHARMa is to use unconditional simulations, but I have often found that conditional simulations are more sensitive to dispersion problems. I recommend trying both, as neither test should be positive if the dispersion is correct.

Taking into account the effect of past actions on future costs in a dynamic distribution-free setting makes online MDPs hard to solve. To the best of our knowledge, only a few methods have been developed in this area over the past decade [@McMahan; @EvenDar; @Yu; @onlineMDP_bandits; @AroraTewari; @onlineMDP_full; @Yadkori; @Zimin; @DickCsaba]. Most research in this area has been algorithmic: given a problem, one would present a method and prove a guarantee (i.e., a regret bound) on its performance. There are two distinct lines of methods: the algorithms presented by [@EvenDar; @Yu; @onlineMDP_bandits] require the computation of relative value functions at each time step, while the algorithms in [@Zimin; @DickCsaba] reduce the online MDP problem to an online linear optimization problem and solve it by online learning methods. These two lines of methods correspond to the two above-mentioned different ways of designing polices for MDPs. From a theoretical and conceptual standpoint, it is desirable to provide a unifying view of existing methods and a general procedure for constructing new ones. In this paper, we present such a general framework for online MDP problems that subsumes the above two approaches.

France is mobilising 10,000 troops to boost security after last week's deadly attacks, and will send thousands of police to protect Jewish schools.

Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said troops would be in place from Tuesday evening in sensitive areas.

It is the first time troops have been deployed within France on such a scale.

Seventeen people were killed in Paris last week in attacks at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, on a police officer, and at a kosher supermarket.

On Sunday, an estimated 3.7 million people took to the streets to show solidarity with the victims, including 1.5 million people in Paris.

About 40 world leaders joined the start of the Paris march, linking arms in an act of solidarity.

President Francois Hollande ordered the deployment of troops during a crisis meeting with top officials early on Monday.

Mr Le Drian said the deployment, the first of its kind, was needed because ""threats remain present"".

Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve announced that nearly 5,000 members of the security forces would be sent to protect France's 717 Jewish schools, and that troops would be sent as reinforcements over the next two days.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls said synagogues would also be protected, as would mosques, following some retaliatory attacks over the Charlie Hebdo killings.

Last week, Mr Valls admitted there had been ""clear failings"" after it emerged that the three gunman involved in the attacks - Said and Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly - had a history of extremism.

media caption Chris Bockman said security was tight at a Jewish school in Toulouse which was the scene of a fatal attack in 2012

The Kouachi brothers were on UK and US terror watch lists and Coulibaly had previously been convicted for plotting to free a known militant from prison. Coulibaly met Cherif Kouachi while in jail.

Coulibaly and the two brothers were shot dead on Friday after police ended two separate sieges.

Coulibaly killed four people at a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris on Friday before police stormed the building. He is also believed to have shot dead a policewoman the day before.

Ahead of Sunday's rally in Paris, a video emerged appearing to show Coulibaly pledging allegiance to the Islamic State militant group.

In the video, he said he was working with the Kouachi brothers: ""We have split our team into two... to increase the impact of our actions.""

The Kouachi brothers claimed they were acting on behalf of Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda (AQAP). But experts say it is highly unlikely that Islamic State and al-Qaeda, rivals in the Middle East, would plan an attack together.

The attacks in Paris started last Wednesday, when the Kouachi brothers raided the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people - including eight journalists and two police officers.

Mr Valls said on Monday that authorities thought that the attackers had at least one accomplice, for whom police are still hunting.

661,0,28960,3075," ideologies that reduces all possible knowledge to that of science, such as the human sciences whose very objectivity deprives them of their object: what value do statistics have faced with suicide, what do they say about the anguish and the despair that produce it? These ideologies have invaded the university, and are precipitating it to its destruction by eliminating life from research and teaching.  Television is the truth of technology; it is the practice par excellence of barbarism: it reduces every event to current affairs, to incoherent and insignificant facts.

This negation of life results, according to Michel Henry, from the ""disease of life"", from its secret dissatisfaction with the self which leads it to deny itself, to flee itself in order to escape its anguish and its own suffering. In the modern world, we are almost all condemned from childhood to flee our anguish and our proper life in the mediocrity of the media universe — an escape from self and a dissatisfaction which lead to violence — rather than resorting to the most highly developed traditional forms of culture which enable the overcoming of this suffering and its transformation into joy. Culture subsists, despite everything, but in a kind of incognito; in our materialist society, which is sinking into barbarism, it must necessarily operate in a clandestine way.

From Communism to Capitalism 
Communism and Capitalism are for Michel Henry two faces of the one death, which consists in the negation of life. Communism eliminates individual life in favour of universal abstractions like society, people, history or social classes. The dogmatism of Marxism is a form of fascism, i.e. a doctrine which originates in the degradation of the individual whose elimination is considered as legitimate, whereas capitalism substitutes economic entities such as money, profit or interest for the real needs of life. Capitalism however recognizes life as a source of value, wages being the objective representation of real subjective and living work. But capitalism progressively gives way to the exclusion of subjectivity by modern technology, which replaces living work by automated technological processes, eliminating at one stroke the power of creating value and ultimately value itself: possessions are produced in abundance, but unemployment increases and there is a continual shortage of money to buy them. These themes are developed in Du communisme au capitalisme, théorie d’une catastrophe (From Communism to Capitalism, Theory of a Catastrophe).

The Book of the Dead 
Henry's planned last book was entitled Le Livre des Morts (The Book of the Dead) and would have dealt with what he called ""clandestine subjectivity"": a theme which evokes the condition of life in the modern world and which also alludes to his commitment to the Resistance and his personal experience of clandestinity.

On art and painting 
Michel Henry was a student of ancient painting and of the great classical painting which preceded the scientistic figuration of the 18th and 19th Centuries, and also of abstract creations such as those of the painter Wassily Kandinsky. Henry dedicated a book entitled Voir l’invisible (Seeing the Invisible) to Kandinsky, in which he describes his work in laudatory terms. He analyses Kandinsky's theoretical writings on art and painting in their spiritual and cultural dimensions as a means of self-growth and refinement of one's sensibility. He explores painting's means of form and colour, and studies their effects on the inner life of one who looks at them filled with wonder, following the rigorous and almost phenomenological analysis proposed by Kandinsky. He explains that every form of painting capable of moving us is in reality abstract, i.e. it is not content to reproduce the world but seeks to express the invisible power and invisible life that we are. He evokes also the great thought of Kandinsky, the synthesis of arts, their unity in the monumental art as well as the cosmic dimension of art.

On Christianity

I am the Truth 
In C’est moi la Vérité, pour une philosophie du christianisme (I am the Truth: Towards a Philosophy of Christianity), Michel Henry confronts his phenomenology of life with the foundational texts of Christianity. Life loves itself with an infinite love and never ceases to engender itself; it never ceases to engender each one of us as its beloved Son or Daughter in the eternal present of life. Life is nothing but this absolute love that religion calls God. That is why Life is sacred, and it is",914,11, for this reason that no-one has the right to
662,0,24627,1025," denote by $L_c$ the average distance between kinks on a infinite facet: we define the low temperature regime as that in which $L_c \gg L$ where L is the typical size of our island, large facets are then visible on the island. It was shown that $L_c=\frac{a}{2} exp(\frac{E}{2k_bT})$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing.\
The behavior of the relaxation time as a function of the temperature and $N$, the number of particles of the island, can be summed up with two equations corresponding to the high and low temperature regimes: $$\begin{aligned}
t^{HT}_{relaxation}& \propto &  \exp[3E/k_bT] N^2 \;  \mbox{for} \; N \gg L_c^2 \label{teqHT} \\
t^{LT}_{relaxation}& \propto & \exp[4E/k_bT] N \; \mbox{for} \; N \ll L_c^2 \label{teqLT}\end{aligned}$$ Replacing the temperature dependent factors by a function of $N_c$ the crossover island size (where $N_c=L_c^2 \propto exp(E/k_bT)$), these two laws can be expressed as a unique scaling function depending on the rescaled number of particles $N/N_c$: $$t_{relaxation } \propto \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll}
   N_c^{5} \left(\frac{N}{N_c}\right)^2 \;
& \mbox{for} \;\frac{N}{N_c} \gg 1  \\
  N_c^{5} \frac{N}{N_c} \;
 & \mbox{for} \;\frac{N}{N_c} \ll 1 
\end{array} \right.$$ So that the relaxation time [@note] is a simple monotonous function of $N/N_c$, and the temperature dependence is contained in $N_c$.\
We will now focus on the precise microscopic description of the limiting step for relaxation in the low temperature regime.

Description of the limiting process at low temperature
======================================================

Qualitative description
-----------------------

During relaxation at low temperature, islands are mostly in fully faceted configurations. Let us, for instance, consider an island in a simple configuration given by fig. \[island\]. When $L$ is larger than $l$, the island is not in its equilibrium shape (which",599,11, should be more or less a regular hexagon). To

It was in the groundbreaking decision in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.

See United States ex rel. Miller v. Twomey, 479 F. 2d 701, 711-713 (CA7 1973). Under that rejected view, the Eighth Amendment's proscription of cruel and unusual punishment would have marked the outer limit of the prisoner's constitutional rights. It is important to emphasize that nothing in the Court's opinion today signals a resurrection of any such approach in cases of this kind. See ante, at 131.

*139 I

A
The Court is asked to consider ""[w]hether prisoners have a right to non-contact prison visitation protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments."" Brief for Petitioners i. In my view, the question presented, as formulated in the order granting certiorari, draws attention to the wrong inquiry. Rather than asking in the abstract whether a certain right ""survives"" incarceration, ante, at 132, the Court should ask whether a particular prisoner's lawful sentence took away a right enjoyed by free persons.
The Court's precedents on the rights of prisoners rest on the unstated (and erroneous) presumption that the Constitution contains an implicit definition of incarceration. This is manifestly not the case, and, in my view, States are free to define and redefine all types of punishment, including imprisonment, to encompass various types of deprivationsprovided only that those deprivations are consistent with the Eighth Amendment. Under this view, the Court's precedents on prisoner ""rights"" bear some reexamination.
When faced with a prisoner asserting a deprivation of constitutional rights in this context, the Court has asked first whether the right survives incarceration, Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974), and then whether a prison restriction on that right ""bear[s] a rational relation to legitimate penological interests."" Ante, at 132 (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)).
Pell and its progeny do not purport to impose a substantive limitation on the power of a State to sentence a person convicted of a criminal offense to a deprivation of the right at issue. For example, in Turner, the Court struck down a prison regulation that prohibited inmates from marrying absent permission from the superintendent. 482 U. S., at 89, 94-99. Turner cannot be properly understood, however, as holding that a State may not sentence those convicted to both imprisonment *140 and the denial of a constitutional right to marry.[*] The only provision of the Constitution that speaks to the scope of criminal punishment is the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and Turner cited neither that Clause nor the Court's precedents interpreting it. Prisoners challenging their sentences must, absent an unconstitutional procedural defect, rely solely on the Eighth Amendment.
The proper inquiry, therefore, is whether a sentence validly deprives the prisoner of a constitutional right enjoyed by ordinary, law-abiding persons. Whether a sentence encompasses the extinction of a constitutional right enjoyed by free persons turns on state law, for it is a State's prerogative to determine how it will punish violations of its law, and this Court awards great deference to such determinations. See, e.",957,11," g., Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S"
664,0,26629,3075," for fraud. It alleges that Wyatt's promise to drop the union grievance if plaintiff would drop his disciplinary charges was made with no intention to perform and was false and fraudulent. As a result of the false promise, the complaint continues, plaintiff ""changed his position as alleged"" to his damage.
Accepting the truth of the allegations of the amended complaint, as we must on a demurrer, plaintiff did allege certain of the basic elements constituting actionable fraud under California law. ""A false promise is actionable on the theory that a promise implies intention to perform, that intention to perform or not to perform is a state of mind, and that misrepresentation of such a state of mind is a misrepresentation of fact. The allegation of a promise (which implies a representation of intention to perform) is the equivalent of the ordinary allegation of a representation of fact."" (Original italics.) (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) § 581, p. 2219, and cases there cited.) Defendant urges, however, that by virtue of section 301 of the L.M.R.A. and the principles announced in Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., supra, 370 U.S. 238, a union agent cannot be held liable under the state tort law for the alleged false promise made in connection with the grievance settlement agreement.[5]
While we do not find any case dealing precisely with the point raised, we have concluded that the proper disposition of plaintiff's second cause of action is, like the claim for breach of contract, controlled by section 301 of the L.M.R.A. and the principles enunciated in Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., supra, 370 U.S. 238.
In Atkinson, the court traced the enactment of section 301, subdivision (b), exempting union agents and members from personal liability for judgments against the union to a deeply felt congressional reaction to the *602 Danbury-Hatters case (Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274 [52 L.Ed. 488, 28 S.Ct. 301]; Lawlor v. Loewe, 235 U.S. 522 [59 L.Ed. 341, 35 S.Ct. 170]) and its aftermath (Loewe v. Savings Bank of Danbury, 236 F. 444). There, the employer brought an antitrust treble damage action against union members, including officers and agents, to recover losses suffered in a nationwide, union-directed boycott of his hats. No judgment was sought or entered against the union, but instead a sizeable money judgment was recovered against the individual defendants for participating in the boycott. As a result of the judgment, numerous union members suffered great financial hardship including loss of their homes.
Viewed in the context of the Danbury-Hatters case, the court in Atkinson held that section 301, subdivision (b), should not be read narrowly but should be given a construction consonant with the evident congressional policy that the union as an entity should be the sole source of recovery of an injury inflicted by it. That policy, declared the court, ""cannot be evaded or truncated by the simple device of suing union agents or members, whether in contract or tort, or both, in a separate count or in a separate action for damages for violation of a collective bargaining contract for which damages the union itself is liable."" (370 U.S. at p. 249 [8 L.Ed.2d at p. 470], italics supplied.)
Plaintiff's cause of action for fraud against Wyatt is foreclosed by the principles declared by Atkinson. Defendant's allegedly fraudulent representation  made while acting as a union agent  was integrally related to the grievance proceedings authorized by the collective bargaining agreement between plaintiff and Local 467. Indeed, defendant's alleged false promise was a part of the grievance settlement agreement. If in these circumstances we were to hold that defendant could be held personally liable for his representations, we would be giving section 301, subdivision (b), the kind of ""niggardly"" reading decried in Atkinson. Unlike conduct marked by violence where states have been permitted to award damages under traditional tort law because the states' interest in the maintenance of domestic peace is not overridden by congressional policy (see San Diego Unions v.

\end{array} \right.,i,q \geq 1$$ where, $P_{i,S}$ and $P_{i,F}$ represent light intensities from the slow-axis and fast-axis after passing through the $i$th adjacent units, respectively, $\rho_{i,j}$ and $\rho_{i,j + q}$ are the coupling coefficients of the point at the right end of Segment $(X_{j - p},X_{j}\rbrack$ and $(X_{j},X_{j + q}\rbrack$, respectively. From Equation (2), the stable units linked end-to-end can be expressed as: $$\left\{ {\begin{array}{l}
{P_{i,S} = - (P_{\text{In,S}} - P_{\text{In,F}})2^{i - 1}{\prod\limits_{i = 1}^{\max\{ i\}}{\rho_{i,j}\rho_{i,j + q}}}} \\
{P_{i,F} = (P_{\text{In,S}} - P_{\text{In,F}})2^{i - 1}{\prod\limits_{i = 1}^{\max\{ i\}}{\rho_{i,j}\rho_{i,j + q}}}} \\
\end{array},\ i,q \geq 1} \right.$$ where, $P_{\text{In,S}}$ and $P_{\text{In,F}}$ are the initial intensities that launch into the slow-axis and fast-axis of the first stable unit along PMF under test, respectively.

### 2.2.2. Classifications and General Formulas {#sec2dot2dot2-sensors-16-00419}

In this section, we consider that the pair of OPs of the first and last segments of the PMF under test. As mentioned above, we set the sequence of adjacent units as $B_{(i,0)} \cup B_{(i, + )}$ to simplify the analysis. However, the two end segments of the entire PMF under test might not be always satisfied the sequence. The OPD of the first and last segments could also conform to the sequence of $\left. \{ B_{(\text{in}, + )} \cup (B_{(1,0)} \cup B_{(1, + )}) \cup \cdot \cdot \cdot \right\}$ and $\left\{ \cdot \cdot \cdot \cup (B_{({last}, + )} \cup B_{({last}, + )}) \cup B_{({out},0)} \right\}$, respectively, where the first segment $B_{(\text{in}, + )}$ and the last segment $B_{(\text{out},0)}$ satisfy the features of $B_{(i, + )}$ and $B_{(i,0)}$, respectively. Therefore, the scanning OPDs of the entire PMF can be categorized into four classifications based on the possible end segments conditions. As shown in [Figure 3](#sensors-16-00419-f003){ref-type=""fig""}, the scanning OPDs of the entire PMF, for simplicity, are denoted by (A) {$B_{(1,0)}$, $B_{({out}, + )}$}, (B) {$B_{({in}, + )}$, $B_{({out},0)}$}, (C) {$B_{(1,0)}$, $B_{({out},0)}$} and (D) {$B_{({in}, + )}$, $B_{({out}, + )}$}, respectively.

1-2-3-4-5. Five leftist lawyers, currently abusing their authority as Supreme Court Justices, unleashed their activism upon the U.S. Constitution Friday and created a non-existent right to same-sex marriage. The Fourteenth Amendment may provide equal protection under the law, but by applying it to expand the definition of marriage the Court has created a constitutional crisis in America. The First and Tenth Amendments, which respectively promise freedom of individual religion and award jurisdiction to the States of all powers not enumerated in the Constitution, have now been placed in direct conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.

“Love Wins”? Not here it doesn’t, nor does anything but the will of five judicial despots, followed by the bullying mob rule of the Left and its Rainbow Mafia. Need proof?

In 2008, before the Saul Alinsky-ite Barack Obama and his Chicagoland gang occupied the White House and began “fundamentally transforming” our nation, there was debate, dissent and dialogue about all sorts of issues, including those issues fomented by the hard Left in order to label the response of the Christian Right as extremist.

In 2008, homosexual couples could enter into a legal, binding contract for shared property, power of attorney for making health care decisions, probate of wills, etc., and were, in most cases, receiving health care benefits from employers. These same homosexual couples were consummating their relationship in the privacy of their own domicile without harassment.

In 2008, Christians could speak their opinions and stand on their faith while understanding their voice was respected in the public square.

In 2015, however, those same Christians are in grave danger of losing legal standing because their beliefs are pitted against a brand new, heretofore undiscovered constitutional right. Tolerance is only for those who agree with the mob-rule Left.

What changed in seven years?

If you ask a moderate Republican, he or she might say, “Elections have consequences,” and shrug, since they never viewed this as meaningful anyway. If you ask the Bible-believing Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan, they shudder at the exchange of timeless principles for sexual license. If you ask a libertarian, you might get the response that devout Christians are the “recalcitrant minority.” But if you ask someone who identifies as Christian first, American second, and is conservative politically, you’ll hear sorrow for a nation that worships the secular triune of me, myself and I rather than our Creator.

Millions of votes cast around the country to support the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman have now been nullified. How will this tyrannical disregard for the enumerated powers of the Constitution play out in the everyday lives of Christians?

In your place of worship, there’s now a government-approved theology that the God-rejecting Left expects to be preached. Whereas Bible-centric congregations stand on Holy Scripture, which does not include one single advocacy of sexual sin or perversion, the homosexual agenda demands that this view be rejected. One of the five black-robed tyrants, Justice Anthony Kennedy — considered the “swing vote” — laughingly attempted to reassure those whose lives revolve around their faith in the Judeo-Christian God by writing, “Those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.”

Get that? We can advocate our opposition, but there is little legal standing in such a weak word. As Chief Justice John Roberts put it, “The majority graciously suggests that religious believers may continue to ‘advocate’ and ‘teach’ their views of marriage. The First Amendment guarantees, however, the freedom to �",830,11,"�exercise’ religion. Ominously,"

Teenagers on the 20-woman roster are 17-year-old Julia Grosso, 18-year-old Emma Regan and 19-year-old Deanne Rose. Regan and Gross are both from the Vancouver Whitecaps FC Girls Elite program while Rose, who already has 33 caps, plays for the University of Florida.

The Vancouver-based Heiner-Moller elected to leave 17-year-old striker Jordyn Huitema with the under-17 squad, which is preparing for the June 6 resumption of the CONCACAF women’s under-17 championship.

The original tournament was suspended April 22, due to security concerns in the host country of Nicaragua. The IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., will host the remaining matches with Canada 1-0-0 after a 3-0 victory over Bermuda in Nicaragua.

Other than Huitema, Heiner-Moller said he got everyone he wanted.

Labbe gets the call despite a lack of playing time after being denied a chance to play for a Calgary men’s team in the PDL by league officials. She expects to join a European team in the near future.

“I hope so,” said Heiner-Moller. “I don’t think that players on this level can go without match minutes for a longer period of time and Steph knows that I think this.”

Canada is 1-5-0 all-time against Germany. The lone win came at the 2016 Rio Olympics when Canada scored a 2-1 upset in preliminary play. Germany had its revenge in the semifinal, winning 2-0.

The Germans went on to defeat Sweden 2-1 in the final while Canada beat Brazil by the same score for the bronze.

The Joy when they get it.

This isn't a post about running. Nope, I do more than just run. I, umm... yeah, there will be more on that list. Just give me a minute.

All those that know me, also know that I am a Mamma to an exceptional kid. An Autistically gifted exceptional kid. Its not a path for the faint-hearted and is in essence a battle against the world in education and tolerance. The education of the masses and your tolerance of idiots.

In Canada, I was pretty used to the stares and mutterings of other parents. When my kid had a fit at a child who pushed in line, it was my kid who had the problem and not the golden 'typical' brat. I have had to remove my child on a number of occasions from a situation because children couldn't deal with my son and the parents were unwilling to be educated. No-one made life easier for you and you just had to accept that this was your deal. You were an outcast from the school gate -- never to mingle with the 'School run hoards'.

This was my standard. I accepted that this would be my life now. Moving to the UK would be no different.

How wrong I was.

Over the last couple of months, I have been overwhelmed by the actions of people who have gone out of their way to make my life easier. These aren't the usual suspects, but just people I have run into doing the normal errands that life throws at you.

Like the customer service lady I spoke to about a prang someone did on my car in a car park (and then left without providing details). It was just before the school summer vacation and I had to leave it. I couldn't risk the car being out of action for weeks whilst D was home. I couldn't get a courtesy car to tide me over, because, well, D is Autistic. This is the boy who refused to get in the car for three days because we moved the car seat to the other back seat. This meant when I eventually called up to report the incident 8 weeks later, I should have been pretty much up the 'insurance creek without a policy paddle'. I explained the situation and tried to not sound to lame when I explained why it had taken so long. Not a problem.

Laura Jackson

Tuesday, 22 September 2015

As part of its 'Beyond Propaganda' series, the Legatum Institute hosted a panel discussion, chaired by Peter Pomerantsev, to launch a collection of papers that look at how 21st century warfare is changing and what can be done to react to information warfare.

Mark Laity, Chief of Strategic Communications at SHAPE, and Ben Nimmo, a prominent information warfare and defence analyst based in Scotland, were joined by Laura Jackson, a leading expert on the South China Sea and Chinese political-military strategy who has worked closely with the United States Secretary of Defense, to discuss their papers and the challenges posed to democratic governments by the current information war.

Laity first laid the groundwork of the debate by explaining the importance of narrative for national strategy. ‘If I want to persuade you to do something, I need to tap into your narrative’, he explained, before showing how Putin publically creates a powerful historical narrative around Ukraine for multiple distinct audiences. The panel then went on to discuss how pertinent the narratives of powers like Russia and China have become. Laity added that the Russians themselves describe their tactics as ‘information confrontation’ and that their approach ‘bridges peace and war’. Jackson claimed of the Chinese ‘They’re learning from Sun Tzu in terms of winning without fighting’, before adding that the holistic nature of China’s three-pronged non-kinetic warfare strategy makes it a new phenomenon, and that the artificial islands being built in the South China Sea are just the tip of the iceberg in China’s wider ambitions to manipulate the international",360,11," order.

682,0,21389,0,"1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates generally to radio frequency power amplifiers and, more particularly, the invention relates to methods of managing the signal to noise floor ratio as the operational bandwidth of a digital linearized predistortion amplifier is expanded.
2. Description of the Related Art
Radio frequency power amplifiers are widely used to transmit signals in communications systems. Typically a signal to be transmitted is concentrated around a particular carrier frequency occupying a defined channel. Information is sent in the form of modulation of amplitude, phase, and/or frequency such that the information is represented by energy spread over a band of frequencies around the carrier frequency. In many schemes the carrier itself is not sent since it is not essential to the communication of the information.
When a signal that contains amplitude variations is amplified, it will suffer distortion if the amplifier does not exhibit a linear amplitude and phase transfer characteristic. This means that the output is not linearly proportional to the input. The signal will also suffer distortion if the phase shift, which the amplifier introduces, is not linear over the range of frequencies present in the signal or if the phase shift caused by the amplifier varies with the amplitude of the input signal. The distortion introduced typically includes intermodulation of the components of the input signal. The products of the intermodulation appear within the bandwidth of the signal causing undesirable interference. The products of the intermodulation also extend outside the bandwidth originally occupied by the signal. This can cause interference in adjacent channels and violate transmitter licensing and regulatory spectral emission requirements. Although filtering can be used to remove the unwanted out of band distortion, this is not always practical, especially if the amplifier is required to operate on several different frequencies.
Distortion products that occur at multiples of the carrier frequency can also be produced in a non-linear amplifier, but are relatively easy to remove by filtering. Intermodulation is also a problem when multiple signals are amplified in the same amplifier even if individually they do not have amplitude variations. This is because the combination of the multiple signals produces amplitude variations as the various components beat with each other by adding and subtracting as their phase relationships change.
Amplifiers can introduce some distortion even if they are well designed. Perfect linearity over a wide range of amplitude is difficult to realize in practice. In addition, as any amplifier nears its maximum output power capacity, the output no longer increases as the input increases. At this point the amplifier is not regarded as linear. A typical amplifier becomes significantly non-linear at a small fraction of its maximum output capacity. This means that in order to maintain linearity, the amplifier is often operated at an input and output amplitude which is low enough that the signals to be amplified are in a part of its transfer characteristic that is substantially linear. This is a method of operation, described as xe2x80x9cbacked off,xe2x80x9d in which the amplifier has a low supplied power to transmitted power conversion efficiency. A xe2x80x9cClass Axe2x80x9d amplifier operating in this mode may be linear enough for transmitting a signal cleanly but might typically be only 1% efficient. This wastes power and means that the amplifier has to be large and relatively expensive. In addition, the wasted power is dissipated as heat, which generally must be removed by cooling means.
Communication schemes using signals which have constant amplitude with frequency and phase modulation can use highly non-linear amplifiers. These types of signals are unaffected by the distortion and the amplifiers can be smaller,",720,11," cooler, more power efficient and less expensive. Modulation"

If they do not have enough cash, they approach other banks in the interbank market to obtain the necessary amount. If a bank does not have enough cash and can not raise the total amount requested on the interbank market, it does not pay out the loan. Interbank and firm loans have the same duration. Additional refinancing costs of banks remain with the firms. Each time step firms and banks repay $\tau$ percent of their outstanding debt (principal plus interest). If banks have excess liquidity they offer it on the interbank market for a nominal interest rate. The interbank relation network is modeled as a fully connected network and banks choose the interbank offer with the most favorable rate. Interbank rates $r_{ij}(t)$ offered by bank $i$ to bank $j$ take into account the specificity of bank $i$, and the creditworthiness of bank $j$. If a firm goes bankrupt the respective creditor bank writes off the respective outstanding loans as defaulted credits. If the bank does not have enough equity capital to cover these losses it defaults. Following a bank default an iterative default-event unfolds for all interbank creditors. This may trigger a cascade of bank defaults. For simplicity’s sake, we assume a recovery rate set to zero for",294,11, interbank loans. This assumption is reasonable in practice for

The Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church (or Russian Orthodox Oldritualist Church, Russian Orthodox Old-Ritualist Church) () is an Eastern Orthodox Church of the Old Believers tradition, which rejected the liturgical and canonical reforms of Patriarch Nikon in the second half of 17th century (Old Believers). It is one of the two Old Believers churches that belong to the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy - together with the Orthodox Old-Rite Church, sometimes also called Lipovan Orthodox Old-Rite Church. 

Since the 18th century until the Council of 1988, the official self-designation of this Church was the Old Orthodox Church of Christ (Древлеправославная Церковь Христова) which should not be confused with Russian Old-Orthodox Church, another church of the Old Believers. Drevlepravoslavie (""Old/Ancient Orthodoxy"") was the common self-designation of the Old Believers and their cause since the 17th century.

The head of the Church carries the title of Metropolitan of Moscow and all Russia (since 1988), with residence at the Rogozhskoye cemetery in Moscow. The current head of the Church, Metropolitan Korniliy (Titov) (formerly, the archbishop of Kazan and Vyatka) was elected by the Most Holy Council on October 18, 2005.  He was installed as Metropolitan on October 23, 2005.

History (Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy in Russia, end of 19th century–present) 

The conversion of Met. Amvrosii caused a bitter reaction of Russian Imperial authorities and he was soon pressed to leave his see, but not before he consecrated another bishop for his new Church - archbishop Kiril (Timofeev). The activity of the Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy on the territory of the Russian Empire met with numerous obstructions from Russian imperial authorities, as well as with an internal schism (see Okruzhniki, Neokruzhniki). The situation was radically changed with the publication in 1905 of the Emperor's Ukaz ""On Religious Tolerance"", soon followed by the ""unsealing"" of the altars at the important religious and cultural center of Old Believers, the Rogozhskoye cemetery.

After the coming of the Bolsheviks to power in 1917 and the Civil war, the Old-Rite Church was subjected to innumerable sufferings and persecutions, just as its former rival, the ""Nikonian"" Russian Orthodox Church. In 1940, the only bishop who was not imprisoned by the Soviet atheistic authorities was Bishop Sava of Kaluga who, in the same year, single-handedly elevated another bishop - Irinarch - to the see of the Archbishop of Moscow.  The period of persecution was followed by the period of relative stability, under a tight control from the Soviet secret services. However, the",643,11, time of perestroika and subsequent changes in the

A tragic story has received much (social) media attention in China and beyond over the past week. It concerns an incident that occurred on January 3rd in the “Spa World” pool in Xiangyang, Shaanxi, where a mother was watching her phone as her 4-year-old son struggled in the water behind her. Footage shows that after 3 minutes, the young boy drowned.

According to Sina News, the woman had taken her son and her 6-year-old daughter to play in the local spa resort’s kid’s pool area. When they were about to leave, the woman, named Xiao, discovered her son was no longer in the shallow end of the pool and she alerted the swimming pool staff.

It allegedly took the staff an hour to find the 4-year-old on the bottom of the swimming pool – he had died by the time they found him. The incident, captured by security cameras, triggered different discussions on Chinese social media about who can be held responsible for the boy’s death and had many netizens talking about the dangers of ‘smartphone addiction.’

“I hope this is a warning for all netizens to put down their phone and don’t be a smartphone addict.”

“If the swimming pool has security cameras it would make sense if they would actually be monitored. They could have saved him if they saw he was drowning,” one netizen says, adding: “I also",373,11, hope this is a warning for all netizens to put
687,0,22488,0,"El Partido Popular ha solicitado al Juzgado de Instrucción número 5 de la Audiencia Nacional, que investiga el caso Bárcenas, que no sea este tribunal el que juzgue el caso, sino la Audiencia Provincial, ya que la cantidad supuestamente defraudada por la formación política apenas alcanza los 1,7 millones de euros, un montante que para el PP no tiene una “grave repercusión en la economía nacional”.

El recurrente recuerda que la ley exige esta condición para que sea la Audiencia Nacional la que se haga cargo del caso o que el delito se haya cometido en multitud de provincias de España, extremo que a juicio de los populares tampoco se ha producido en este caso. La formación, argumentan, “es un partido político cuyo domicilio fiscal se encuentra en Madrid”, al igual que los de Luis Bárcenas y Álvaro Lapuerta.

Para justificar que el montante de 1,7 millones de euros no es suficiente para que se encargue la Audiencia Nacional, el PP pone como ejemplo otros casos que investigan cantidades claramente superiores a los dos millones de euros, como el de Rodrigo Rato, que instruye el Juzgado número 31 de Madrid, o el de Neymar, donde el juez rastrea un fraude que sobrepasaría los 12 millones de euros y que investiga el Juzgado número 22 de Barcelona tras ser rechazado por la Audiencia Nacional.

El extesorero, Álvaro Lapuerta. (EFE)

En el caso Bárcenas, considera el PP, “es una perogrullada remarcar que su impacto grave en la economía nacional o en la seguridad del tráfico mercantil es inexistente, pero es que tampoco puede soportarse (ni lo hacen las acusaciones) que las mismas hayan afectado a una pluralidad de personas en el territorio de más de una audiencia”.

Por otro lado, el escrito rechaza las responsabilidades civiles acordadas por el Juzgado tras solicitarlo las acusaciones populares (1,2 millones por no abonar el PP el Impuesto de Sociedades de 2008 y un millón por no hacerlo Unifica en 2007). Defiende que ni la Fiscalía ni la Abogacía del Estado las han solicitado porque entienden que “las donaciones (que son la base del supuesto delito que se le atribuye a la formación) se encuentran exentas de tributar” por el mencionado impuesto.

Además, argumenta que el Tribunal Supremo considera que el delito de malversación está afectado por la doctrina Atutxa, que entiende que este tipo penal afecta a intereses colectivos y sociales y que, por lo tanto, la acusación popular puede solicitar la apertura de juicio oral. Sin embargo, según el mismo tribunal (STS 4/2015) –continúa el PP–, el delito fiscal (que es el que se dirime en este caso) no ataca intereses colectivos y, por lo tanto, la acusación popular no puede solicit",896,11,ar la apertura de juicio. “

692,0,21889,1025," Those who condemn people for being hateful and judgmental actually are being hateful and judgmental themselves!

Fifth, believing in absolutes not only puts a person at risk for vitriol and strong criticism; it also requires a person to think through his or her position and to defend it intellectually, at least in his or her own mind. Put another way, believing truth to be relative is the “PLR”—the “path of least resistance.”

Sixth, relativism appeals to human pride.

I want to spend just a few minutes exploring this last item, for it probably is the primary reason relativism is so attractive. Scripture proves just how relevant it is even in its opening pages, because even there it reveals pride as a core reason for the mess in which humanity finds itself.

In Genesis 1 and 2 we see that at the dawn of creation God created a perfect world with a perfect garden, and He put Adam and Eve, the first man and woman, in it and given them constructive work to do. He placed only one prohibition on them; they were not to eat from the fruit from one tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (see Gen. 1:26-31; 2:15-25). Perfection disappeared in Genesis 3. Satan, in the form of the serpent, enticed Eve to disobey God. Here is how it happened.

1 Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”

2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’”

4 Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate (Gen. 3:1-6, emphasis added).

We see here that Satan not only enticed Eve with good-looking fruit and with lies that confused her about God’s intentions for her and for Adam, he also enticed her with the temptation to play god! This temptation appeals to pride as does nothing else! Note also the connections between pride, playing God, and relativism. Essentially Satan said, “Eve, you can make up your own reality! You can make up your own truth! You can become like God!”

Instead, when they sinned, Adam and Eve died spiritually and began to die physically as well. God also expelled them from the perfect environment where He originally had placed them. The top image is a detailed section of Italian painter Masaccio’s 1425 fresco titled “The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden.” The artist didn’t get everything right in his painting; God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins before expelling them. His depictions Adam’s and Eve’s expressions of horror and shame, however, are quite fitting and appropriate.

The late Dr. Mark Corts pastored Calvary Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for nearly 40 years. A powerful and insightful preacher, Dr. Corts offered many keen observations from the pulpit during his ministry. Here is one of them: The essence of sin is always trying to be like God without God.

The essence of sin is always trying to be like God without God.
—Dr. Mark Corts—

After we—the members of the human race—fell into sin, God implemented a plan to make us like Himself, but that plan requires us to surrender to Him and follow His way, not our own.

We said earlier in the radio commentary that “Christians believe in absolute standards of right and wrong, standards determined by the character of a holy God.” We’ll explore this statement in a future post, but for now, don’t miss these important points.

Cut the deck in half. Place the bottom half on top of the card placed on top. This puts the card you memorized directly on top of their card. You can do as many cuts as you want, as long as they are single cuts.

Look through the cards. Pretend to look for jokers and take them out, but also find the card you memorized. Their card is resting directly on top of it. Cut the deck again so that their card is on top.

Cutting the deck a second time may take a few trials and errors before doing it seamlessly.[4]

A block of Shattuck Avenue in downtown Berkeley could see major changes in the next few years with the construction of an eight-story, 209-unit housing complex between Channing Way and Durant Avenue.

William Schrader Jr., of The Austin Group, has become a familiar name in Berkeley development circles, having already built large projects, such as the eight-story StoneFire on University Avenue and the 79-unit Varsity Apartments at 2024 Durant Ave., downtown in recent years.

His new project, dubbed Logan Park, is slated to be built just east of the Varsity building on Durant, wrapping around the Shattuck Avenue block where Staples, Extreme Pizza, Heat Café, Endless Summer Sweets and Chase bank now operate. Schrader told the zoning board he is working closely with all of those businesses so that the new retail spots fit their needs. Logan Park, if approved, would be located at 2352 Shattuck, which is the largest parcel in downtown Berkeley, he said.

Quantization and Waves {#QandW}
======================

In 1923 Duane[@Du1923], Breit[@Br1923], and Compton[@Co1923] applied the quantization condition to the interaction of x-ray photons with an infinite, periodic crystal lattice and were able to obtain Bragg’s law of reflection without directly invoking the wave nature of x-rays. A somewhat simpler case is that of photons incident on an infinite diffraction grating. Figure 1 is a replica of the schematic diagram in Breit’s 1923 paper where $h\nu/c =p_{\gamma}$ is the momentum of the incident photon, $G$ is the diffraction grating, $D_{0},D_{\pm1},D_{\pm2},...$ are the positions of the slits of the grating, $\theta$ is the scattering angle, and $P$ is the transverse momentum of the emergent photon. Now assume that the momentum transferred from the

radiation to the grating is governed by $\oint pdx=nh$ where $p$ is in a direction parallel to its surface and the integral is taken over the transverse distance necessary to bring the system back to its original condition, i.e., the line spacing $d=D_{k+1}-D_{k}$. In this case, the average momentum transferred to the grating is $\langle p \rangle=\oint pdx/\oint dx = nh/d$ and by conservation of momentum this must also be the magnitude of the transverse momentum transferred to an incident photon, i.e., $P=\langle p \rangle$. If photons are incident perpendicular to the plane of the grating, then the allowed angles at which they are transmitted through the grating are given by $\sin \theta_n=\langle p \rangle/",521,11,p_{\gamma}$.[^12]

UNITED NATIONS, Oct 2 2017 (IPS) - Having faced a year of record temperatures and devastating hurricanes, the United States stands more to lose if it doesn’t take steps to reduce the risk and impact of climate change, according to a new report.

Launched by the Universal Ecological Fund, it details the costs of the U.S.’ climate inaction to the national economy and public health and urges for policies to move the country towards a sustainable future.

“It’s not about ideology, it’s about good business sense,” the former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the report’s co-author James McCarthy told IPS.

“Many people say that they will not have the discussion because they are not convinced of the science—well then, let’s just look at the economics, let’s look at what it is costing to not have that discussion,” he continued.

A Wake of Destruction

The U.S. is still reeling from an unprecedented month of three hurricanes and 76 wildfires, devastating landscapes from Puerto Rico to Washington.

Hurricane Maria alone left Puerto Rican residents without food, water, or electricity. Approximately 44 percent of the population lacks clean drinking water and just 11 out of 69 hospitals have fuel or power, pushing the island to the brink of a humanitarian crisis.

“This year was nothing like we’ve seen,” said McCarthy.

Though aid delivery is underway, the economic losses from not only Hurricane Maria, but also Hurricanes Harvey and Irma along with the wildfires that swept through the Western coast, are estimated to be the costliest weather events in U.S. history.

The report estimates a price-tag of nearly 300 billion dollars in damage, representing 70 percent of the costs of all 92 weather events in the last decade.

Since hurricane season is yet to end, more expensive and damaging storms may still be in the forecast.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental Information, the number of extreme weather events that incurred at least one billion dollars in economic losses and damages have increased in the last decade by almost two and a half times.

Such losses will only rise as human-induced climate change continues, contributing to dry conditions favorable for more wildfires and warm oceans which lead to more intense storms and higher sea levels.

McCarthy, who is also an Oceanography Professor at Harvard University, told IPS that investments beyond creating hurricane-proof infrastructure are needed to counter such damage.

“Infrastructure is important, but everything we can do to reduce the intensity of these events, by slowing the rate of global warming, will make future infrastructure more likely to be effective,” he said.

An Unhealthy Dependence

Among the major drivers of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels which the U.S. continues to rely on to produce energy.

Coal, oil and natural gas—all of which are fossil fuels— currently account for over 80 percent of the primary energy generated and used in the North American nation. When such fossil fuels are burned, large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) are released to the atmosphere, contributing to rapid changes in the climate.

Though emissions regulations have reduced air pollution health damages by 35 percent, or nearly 67 billion dollars per year, burning fossil fuels still produces health costs that average 240 billion dollars every year.

If fossil fuels continue to be used, both economic losses and health costs are estimated to reach at least 360 billion dollars annually, or 55 percent of U.S.’ growth, over the next decade.

And the government won’t be footing the expensive bill, the report notes.

“Time after time, we are going to see the public bearing the costs…it becomes a personal burden for them,” McCarthy told IPS.

He highlighted the importance of the U.S. taking steps to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

“To move people, literally and figuratively, into the future to be more healthy and more sustainable and a less expensive way of doing business just makes sense,” McCarthy said.

Not only will it provide sustainable clean electricity and reduce the rate of global warming, renewable energy also can add to the economy by producing jobs.

Clean energy already employs almost 2 million workers, and doubling solar and wind generation can create another 500,000 jobs.

Scie chimiche su Grugliasco

Fake news, odio verso gli stranieri e il solito ambientalismo pieno di retorica. Nei post su facebook il ""profilo"" della candidata sindaca grillina nella Stalingrado dell'Ovest - TUTTO IL REPERTORIO NELLA GALLERY

Scie chimiche, frasi inneggianti allo sterminio dei rom, un occhiolino a CasaPound e a Salvini. Ma anche tante fake news “gentiste”, contro il Pd, contro i cinesi e gli stranieri in generale, a sostegno della famigerata cura “di Bella” e foto di gattini in quantità. È tutto sulla pagina facebook di Lella Bottazzi, la candidata sindaca del M5s a Grugliasco che la settimana scorsa ha ricevuto la visita del vicepresidente della Camera Luigi Di Maio. “Vogliamo migliorare le cose - ha detto -. Ho 56 anni, potevo starmene in un angolino, ma l’ho fatto perché ho un figlio di 28 anni, abita qui e avrà una famiglia qui, quindi voglio migliorare il luogo in cui viviamo”. Queste le sue poche semplici frasi pronunciate prima di lasciare spazio a Di Maio e al suo comizio.

Supportata dai consiglieri regionali Davide Bono e Francesca Frediani, ma anche dalla “padrona di casa”, la deputata Laura Castelli, la candidata di Grugliasco basa la sua campagna elettorale sulle più classiche delle lotte ambientaliste: stop alla cementificazione, più raccolta differenziata, migliori collegamenti pubblici con la città e stop all’inceneritore.

Tuttavia è su facebook che Bottazzi mostra il suo amore per gli animali, con decine e decine di post su gattini e cani randagi in cerca di cure. La candidata M5s è talmente legata agli animali da invocare lo sterminio dei rom dopo la devastazione del canile: “Casa pound vuole fare un'azione dimostrativa. Spero li massacrino”, scriveva il 21 maggio 2015 per poi aggiungere: “Questi bastardi devono andarsene con le buone o con le cattive. Un umano si difende un peloso no e questo mi fa andare in bestia”. E ancora: “E ditemi che dobbiamo sterminarli. Provate a dirmelo”.

Non sono gli unici post vagamente xenofobi.

The point is that the information is clearly there, and with current
technology it is possible to extract it under ideal circumstances. It's not to
say it's feasible or will be, but it's not hard to imagine sensors becoming
advanced enough to capture the required light without using a special lens and
artificially illuminate the bystanders.

Wrong, current image sensors have around ~50% quantum efficiency nowadays. [1]
That's 1 f-stop from the theoretical maximum, while they're pushing around 10
f-stops above the top-of-the-line mobile phone cam / security cam.

The pace of technology is still limited by physics - if they take out the 2kW
monster flash then the lens size needs to be increased to a diameter of
several meters, just to maintain the same performance at a distance of 1 meter
(!).

You're missing the point. This is not a paper on image acquisition, it is a
paper on image processing. Because they began from scratch, they used very
favorable image conditions. They are not pushing the idea that their capture
format is representative of an application.

We have no idea how hard it would be to recover an image using 50-5% of the
light. No one has written that paper. Same for resolution. The paper does not
claim to address that question so it seems silly to critique it for not doing
so.

Is this site for experts, or not?

On the one hand, this question here about what RPG.SE is, and this answer here about answering FATE questions, specify ""[this site] is a collection of expert knowledge"" and ""Expert questions to be answered by Experts"". On the other hand, the help page states

Anybody can ask a question
Anybody can answer

and this answer has several newbie-friendly nuggets of wisdom. This question is encouraging, too.
In the question about FATE, one bit of an answer stated:

It seems like people are so bogged down with non-expert fate questions
that the first instinct is to give an answer suited for a beginner in
the system and not an expert.

This points out that there are non-experts asking questions, that they are many (how are they bogging down people otherwise?), and that they aren't really welcome (at least, not by the answerer): they ask the ""wrong"" sort of questions.
So which is it?
I ask because I'm not an expert on D&D 4E, 2E, Numenera or Fiasco. I just play and GM them. I have very limited time and chances to play, often having dry spells of months between 4-hour sessions. I enjoy rereading my corebooks and splats, but without actual playtime, my questions and answers will never actually be of ""expert level"".
The help page is inclusive, and makes me feel I can actually ask questions here. The first answers and comments cited don't, they make me feel that I can at best lurk and check from time to time if something interesting shows up. In the end, I feel I'm almost restating this question, though not exactly.

Return to FAQ Index

A:

If you play RPGs, you're an expert and welcome.
The line ""Asking Expert questions, getting expert answers"" has a particular history dating to when it was just the original three sites. ""Expert questions"" was important because they didn't want to teach askers the basics of how to program. Being an expert meant that you already knew how to program and what programming meant.
The parallel here isn't perfect, so those words aren't so meaningful here. In practice we're OK fielding a question that is asking to be taught what RPGs are, so long as we don't get too many of them. We're not interested in teaching every comer how to RPG, so mostly we end up closing them as unclear or duplicates of the two or three existing questions about getting started. But we have them.
So what does that say about where we draw the line between expert and non-expert?

“Magic was singing in me, through me; I felt the murmur of his power singing back that same song.”

Every ten years The Dragon takes a girl from the valley. Everyone knows that he will take Kasia. Agnieszka doesn’t want to lose her best friend, she prepares for years knowing that the loss will happen. The people have to give up a girl so that The Dragon will protect them from the evil wood. But when The Dragon comes it turns out he doesn’t want Kasia after all…

It’s very rare that standalone fantasies exist, and perhaps there is a reason for that. It’s very limiting to build a world and characters in such a short span of time but that is something the book succeeds at. The fault here is the plot, the characters and perhaps the writing style itself.

Novik manages to craft a complex world, with a magic system and politics in a little over four-hundred pages. Something it takes many writers several books to do. There’s a wide variety of characters but they all sort of feel the same. People in the villages are all interchangeable. Agnieszka’s main trait is being impressively powerful and dirty. The Dragon is a jerk. Kasia is wooden and one-note. Characters all have a single motivation and build their bland personalities around that.

There are some faults of course. I went in expecting to wholly love every inch of this book, so maybe I set myself up for disappointment. I didn’t like the romance. It felt out of place, underdeveloped and unnecessary. Not every book needs a romantic thread and this one certainly didn’t. The age gap is weird, their relationship is weird – it just feels like the book would have been better off without it.

The plot does feel a little dragged out but, for the most part, it’s fast paced and interesting. There’s very little focus on the political side of Novik’s world which I feel was a misstep but the main points still get across. The ending was…strange and left some questions unanswered but it was satisfying in a way. It was never properly foreshadowed so it felt pulled from thin air. It also robbed the Wood of being a unique villain to a pretty standard fairy tale one.

It is difficult for me to put my finger on exactly where this book went wrong, why exactly it isn’t the five-star dreamboat I’d hoped it would be. It felt sort of bland. The main character is stronger than anyone ever in history and learns special secrets and it just feels unfair. Deaths are common in this book, but not a single character we care for dies. It’s a safe, standard fantasy in the end. Novik built a wonderful world – but it’s not that different from many others.

I wanted to love this book, but it felt tedious to read and aside from the “shocking” ending it was all standard fair.

The expression levels of these three transcription factors were significantly increased in the HLG compared with the GG, indicating that high-dose liraglutide regulated glucose metabolism and protected β-cell function by increasing the mRNA expression levels of Pax4, Pax6, and Pdx1, inducing insulin secretion by promoting pancreatic β-cell proliferation or differentiation. These findings are supported by previous studies that have described a stimulatory effect on the pancreatic β-cell mass of liraglutide in diabetic db/db mice \[[@b28-medscimonit-24-3293],[@b29-medscimonit-24-3293]\].

Well, it's the defending NFC champions that are next on the schedule and they offer up a bevy of obstacles for the Cowboys to overcome. However, these aren't the same Seahawks that we've seen in back-to-back Super Bowls, they are having their own set of struggles that could favor the Cowboys and allow them to escape with a victory.

When The Cowboys Have The Ball

Offensively, the Cowboys are going to have some trouble moving the ball against this defense that is in the top of the league in many categories. The one positive for the Cowboys is that they seem to have found some rhythm in the running game and their offensive line has really improved with the addition of La'el Collins to the starting lineup. The Seattle defensive line is a very strong unit but they struggled against the Cowboys last season due to the physical nature of their offensive line. It's roughly the same lineup for Seattle defensively but the addition of Frank Clark has given the Seahawks the same luxury as the Cowboys have with Randy Gregory. The Cowboys will have to continue their stat-busting style of running. The Giants came into last week's contest as the seventh-best rushing defense, they walked away as the 21st ranked rushing defense.

For Dallas, they must get this running game going against the sixth-best rushing defense. Bryan Broaddus and others have expressed their belief in the offensive line being skilled enough to run against any opponent and with Dez Bryant back in the fold, that should bode well for their chances at success. Dallas' offensive line found their groove last week by running Darren McFadden and getting him help with reverses. Bobby Wagner has been a very good player for the Seahawks but getting an extra guy to chip him could create rushing lanes for McFadden to take advantage. Dallas also has PFF's second-rated pass protecting unit behind Cleveland and quick slants to Dez could be exactly what the doctor ordered.

It can't be said enough how much having Dez back will help this offense. Even if Dez is not 100%, the thought is that his presence can still",462,11, mean a lot for this team both mentally and physically.

‘Memory Containers’ was the project theme set by Alessi for two hundred invited international designers and artisans in 1990. Following the success of her show in Tokyo that year, Susan Cohn, a gold and silversmith from Melbourne, was invited to participate.

Inspired by early Australian colonial meat safes constructed from timber with perforated metal panels, Cohn designed a large diameter twin layer fruit bowl.

In each unique Cohncave bowl the two perforated layers are offset to produce a moiré pattern. Cohn’s concept for a mass produced artisan piece saw the Cohncave short listed to a final group of nine designs.

All short listed designers submitted sketches – except for Cohn – who presented an exquisite prototype still prized by Alberto Alessi. The Cohncave was released in 1992 and Cohn would become the first of many Melbourne designers to work with Alessi.

Gold category Welschriesling items, sparkling sunshine, magnificent panorama and people loosening up more and more thanks to the light wines. At the fiesta organized around the first public tasting of Csopak's 2013 wines, we asked the minds behind the Csopak Codex, István Jásdi and Tamás Kovács about this year's harvest and the characteristics of a good Welschriesling from Csopak.

Last Saturday, you could enjoy wine tastings and wine cellar tours at 5 venues in Csopak and at 1 location in Paloznak, all-day-long. In addition to Jásdi Winery (boasting of a picturesque panorama) and the Szent Donát Winehouse, the Söptei, the Koralevics and the Petrányi wineries of Csopak and the Homola in Paloznak received and entertained a flow guests.

After this year's rainy summer, next year's autumn will definitely arrive with less good wine - this is already considered a certainty among the majority of Csopak's winemakers. But let us not rush forward, because there is still reason to celebrate this year! The weather in 2013 was favourable for the Welschriesling as well as for a lot of other varieties. The independent jury rewarded 13 wines of the 2013 vintage with the highest, Vinea Csopak Nobilis Districtus (VDNC Csopak) qualification.

Photo:
Csongor Kiripolszky /welovebalaton.hu

From the gold category wines, we tasted Siralomvágó 2013 by the Jásdi Winery. It displayed slight mineral and herbal flavours, and was light and savoury. The Lőcedombi Welschriesling 2013 by István Jásdi was also justly chosen to be a Codex Wine. Less known but promising are the wines by the Guden Birtok. The Szent Donát Winery's Welschriesling from 2013 was pleasant when consumed in the authentic cellar, but the flavours multiplied when we sipped the second glass on the winery's terrace, gazing at the Balaton panorama.

We had the vintner of the Szent Donát Winery and secretary of the Csopak Codex, Tamás Kovács guide us among the rules of the uniform, but by no means simple rating system of the Csopak wine region. The goal of the Codex that was drawn up in cooperation with istván Jásdi is to preserve the wine culture of Csopak. And, accordingly, a wine must fit strict criteria to be granted the title ""csopaki"", meaning ""of Csopak"".

Photo:
Csongor Kiripolszky /welovebalaton.hu

The grape can only originate from the 26 protected, first class vineyards, and only wines made of the Welschriesling variety can be labelled Csopaki. These are the fundamental requirements stated by the Codex, which, when fulfilled entitle the Welschriesling in question to the basic, VDN Csopak qualification. There are of course additional requirements to fulfil, such as the minimum alcohol content of 12% and bottled distribution. The gold category, VDNC Csopak qualification has even stricter requisites. In this case, the end product is not everything; the vine pruning technique, the cellar processes, the harmony of the alcohol and the acid content and a row of other factors also play a part. The winemakers who wish to have their wines judged in this category must be ready for all-round inspection at all times. For a greater insight to the Csopaki Kódex, Tamás Kovács recommends the browsing of the official homepage - which for the moment is only available in Hungarian.

The real point of the Csopak Codex is the comparability of the wines of this region. I.e. the creation of a set of standards in which Csopak wines show uniformity, but above which all wineries should create their own characteristic world of flavours.

I have begun taking 50mg of Zoloft each evening for OCD and depression. Today being my fourth day, the only side effects I have experienced are a spaced out feeling and a tinnitus (light hiss) in my ears (both not constant, but intermittent throughout the day, lasting no more than 15 minutes at a time). I understand that the side effects of Zoloft may lessen after time, so I definitely plan to continue taking it. I just need to ask if it is possible to end up with permanent Tinnitus as a result of an 8 week trial on Zoloft?

I will do most anything to feel better from OCD/Depression. But damaging my hearing is not one of them.

You should monitor this carefully with your doctor if it persists. To my knowledge, you are not in danger of any permanent hearing loss, but if there is an increase or persistenced of tinnitus, I would check it out, and stop the medication at that time.

A little over two years ago I was put on extremely low dose of Zoloft (only 25 mgs a day) to help control a severe OCD flare up caused by my divorce.

After only three days on it, I experienced bizarre thoughts (separate from the OCD; you can just tell the difference), night sweats, and a constant hissing/ringing in my ear. It sounded like very light crickets chirping, with a mild hiss, in might right ear only.

That did it for me. I refused to take it any more; there was no way I was going to continue with the hope that the side effects would just disappear. Anyway, the ringing almost completely went away but I still notice it a bit here and there, so I wonder if a bit of ear damage may have been done.

Cognitive therapy alone works wonders, if you just give it a chance :-)

This past June, I was prescribed 50 mg of zoloft for anxiety. In mid July, I began to notice a tone in my right ear. My doc suggested I visit an ent. By mid August, it was so loud that I coulnt sleep at night, and I wanted to put my head through a window. The ent suggested I stop the zoloft. After 9 weeks off zoloft, the tone is reduced to a milder but still noticiable hiss which elevates if I become stressed. I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, and if it eventually went away, and how long that took.

The simple answer to the question 'can Zoloft cause permanent tinnitus' is yes, and that goes for for all the SSRI's. According to Dr Stuart Shipko, who runs a panic disorder clinic in CA, Zoloft is the worst of the lot though. He does warn that STOPPING taking the SSRI may make the tinnitus even worse though, so if you've been on it for some time, perhaps you'd be better off staying on it, if it's working for you. I only took zoloft once. It sent me tinnitus sky-high within 90 minutes, and I never took another tablet. The tinnitus came back down again. I've had temporary increases of this kind from Luvox also, but permanent ones from prozac and celaxa.

BTW the idea of SSRI's causing permanent tinnitus is not commonly accepted. The drugs are not ototoxic (i.e. they don't cause any actual damage to the hearing mechanism as far as anyone knows), so it is assumed that they can't cause tinnitus. My PERSONAL and unqualified opinion is that they cause tinnitus without hearing loss by altering brain chemistry. i.e. the tinnitus is neurological in origin.

I don't want to scare you. It is quite possible that the tinnitus will go away. In many if not most people it does. But there are certainly people in whom it doesn't. I think it is supposed to be a temporary side effect. If you still have it 8 weeks on I would be suspicious of it.

NB if zoloft caused this problem for you, I would steer clear of any SSRI",939,11," anti-depressants, and try a different family"

v.
HARWYN PUBLISHING CORPORATION and Bankers Trust Company, Defendants.
No. 64 Civ. 3862.
United States District Court S. D. New York.

*520 *521 Colton & Pinkham, by Spencer Pinkham, New York City, for plaintiff.
Gartenberg & Ellenoff, by Irving L. Gartenberg, New York City, for defendant Harwyn Publishing Corporation.

OPINION
BONSAL, District Judge.
Plaintiff Travis Investment Company (plaintiff), a Colorado partnership, instituted this diversity action against defendants Harwyn Publishing Corporation (Harwyn) and Bankers Trust Company (Bankers), both New York corporations, for damages resulting from an alleged failure to transfer shares of Class A common stock of Harwyn (Harwyn stock). The action was discontinued as against Bankers before trial.
In the pretrial order, filed on November 15, 1966, the parties stipulated that the following facts were not in dispute:
1. Travis is a money lender. On or about October 10, 1963, the plaintiff loaned $25,000 to one, Jay Cohan, a resident of Denver, originally secured by 3800 shares of Harwyn stock of which 1000 shares were subsequently returned to Mr. Cohan. On January 8, 1964, the plaintiff similarly loaned $25,000 to one, Stanley M. Singer, originally secured by 3200 shares of Harwyn stock, subsequently increased to 5300. The promissory notes given by Messrs. Cohan and Singer to the plaintiff each contained a provision that, upon any default, the plaintiff might sell the collateral at public or private sale or on any broker's board without any demand or notice to the borrower.
Prior to the 1st of February, 1964, both of said notes were in default, and the plaintiff, being the holder thereof, became entitled, as between itself and the borrowers, to sell said Harwyn stock pursuant to the terms of said notes.
At all times herein mentioned, Bankers was transfer agent of Harwyn's stock.
2. On or about February 20, 1964, Bankers, as transfer agent for Harwyn, received written notification from the New York Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) that it (the S.E.C.) had reason to believe that shares of Harwyn stock might appear upon the market which were owned by persons in a control relationship with Harwyn and which persons might attempt to sell such shares without registration and without the availability of an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933. Bankers was requested to notify the S.E.C. in respect of any request for transfer of any of Harwyn stock. At or about the same time the S.E.C. had advised Harwyn that it had reason to believe that a control group located in Denver, Colorado, Boston, Massachusetts, and Canada was unlawfully seeking to sell shares of Harwyn stock in the over-the-counter market and requested Harwyn to advise the S.E.C. of any request for transfer of any shares originating from any of those areas prior to transfer.
3. About February 21, 1964, Travis delivered its certificates for 8100 shares of Harwyn stock to Bache & Co. (Bache), its broker, with a request that Bache sell the same as rapidly as it could, but from time to time, in an orderly manner, so as to realize as favorable prices as might be possible.
4. On February 21, 1964, Mr. Charles D. Halsey, a General Partner of Bache, spoke with Bankers and with Mr. Soloway of Gartenberg & Ellenoff, attorneys for Harwyn, and asked whether there had been any transfer stops placed against any shares of Harwyn stock. On February 25, 1964, Mr. Halsey sent a list to Mr. Soloway setting forth the names in which the certificates making up the 8100 shares of Harwyn stock were registered and the certificate numbers of each such certificate.

The name Dniester derives from Sarmatian dānu nazdya ""the close river."" The Dnieper, also of Sarmatian origin, derives from the opposite meaning, ""the river on the far side"". Alternatively, according to Vasily Abaev Dniester would be a blend of Scythian dānu ""river"" and Thracian Ister, the previous name of the river, literally Dān-Ister (River Ister). The Ancient Greek name of Dniester, Tyras (Τύρας), is from Scythian tūra, meaning ""rapid."" 

The names of the Don and Danube are also from the same Indo-Iranian word *dānu ""river"". Classical authors have also referred to it as Danaster. These early forms, without -i- but with -a-, contradict Abaev's hypothesis. Edward Gibbon refers to the river both as the Niester and Dniester in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.

In Ukrainian, it is known as  (translit. Dnister), and in Romanian as. In Russian, it is known as  (translit. Dnestr), in Yiddish: Nester נעסטער; in Turkish, Turla.

Geography 
The Dniester rises in Ukraine, near the city of Drohobych, close to the border with Poland, and flows toward the Black Sea. Its course marks part of the border of Ukraine and Moldova, after which it flows through Moldova for, separating the main territory of Moldova from its breakaway region Transnistria. It later forms an additional",440,11," part of the Moldova-Ukraine border, then flows"
713,0,21509,2050," in this long climb of mankind toward plenty that we had reached
Mount Pisgah, where we looked over the promised land of abolished poverty. Then men
began to quarrel over the division of the goods. The depression produced by war destruction
temporarily checked our march toward the promised land.

Then came the little prophets of the New Deal. They announce the striking solution
that the way out is to produce less and to increase prices so the people can buy less.
They have kept on providing some new restriction or burden or fright down to a week
ago.

At least it has enabled the New Deal to take a few hundred thousand earnest party
workers to the promised land. It takes the rest of us for a ride into the wilderness
of unemployment.

[D] Hubbard School of Economics

Can democracy stand the strain of Mother Hubbard economics for long? Will there be
anything left in the economic cupboard but a bone?

Any examination of the economic muddle of the past three years shows the constant
threat of price fixing, restriction of production and drive against small business.
That is the soul of monopoly. That has maintained from the NRA to the last tax bill.
These are old tricks in no new disguise which put shackles upon the freedom of men.

In desperate jumping from one muddle to another we have seen repeated violation of
morals and honor in government. Do I need to recall the repudiation of obligations,
the clipping of the coin, the violation of trust to guard the Constitution, and the
coercion of the voter? When the standards of honor and morals fail in government,
they will fail in a people.

There are some moral laws written in a Great Book. Over all there is the Gospel of
Brotherhood. For the first time in the history of America we have heard the gospel
of class hatred preached from the White House. That is human poison far more deadly
than fear. Every reader of the history of democracy knows that is the final rock
upon which all democracies have been wrecked.

There is the suggestion in the Gospels that it is the meek who will inherit the earth.
The New Deal will have little inheritance. There are recommendations as to righteousness
for righteousness' sake only. I will not elaborate that.

If all this is the theory and practice of muddle, where has it brought us, even now?
We have spent $15,000,000,000 more than the last administration. We have a debt ten
billions greater than even the Great War debt. After three years we still have the
same number of unemployed that we had at the election of November, 1932. These actions
are bringing injury to the well being of people it purports to serve. It has produced
gross reactionarism in the guise of liberalism. And above all, the New Deal has brought
that which George Washington called ""alterations which may impair the energy of the
system and thus overthrow that which cannot be directly overthrown.”

Republicans! After a hundred and fifty years, we have arrived at that hour.

[E] Americanism Poisoned by New Deal

The New Deal may be a revolutionary design to replace the American system with despotism.
It may be the dream stuff of a false liberalism. It may be the valor of muddle.
Their relationship to each other, however, is exactly the sistership of the witches
who brewed the caldron of powerful trouble for Macbeth. Their product is the poisoning
of Americanism.

The President has constantly reiterated that he will not retreat. For months, to
be sure, there has been a strange quiet. Just as the last campaign was fought on
promises that have been broken, so apparently this campaign is to be slipped through
by evasion.

But the American people have the right to know now, while they still have power to
act. What is going to be done after election with these measures which the Constitution
forbids and the people by their votes have never authorized? What do the New Dealers
propose to do with these unstable currencies, unbalanced budgets, debts and taxes?
Fifty words would make it clear. Surely the propaganda agencies which emit half a
million words a day could find room for these fifty. I noticed they recently spent
300 words on how to choose a hat. It is slightly more important to know the fate
of a nation.

You have the duty to determine the principles upon which the Republican party will
stand. You make the laws of the party. Whether it is within the party or a government,
our system is a government of laws and not of men, and the Republican party holds
its promises and its laws.

The immediate task is to set the country on the road of genuine recovery",1013,11," from the
paths of instability. We have enough"

Ahead of the fifth Die Hard movie, A Good Day To Die Hard, LWLies pitch some potential continuations for this workhorse action franchise.

A new Die Hard film is released in the UK on 14 February and has been given the stretching-it-a-little title of A Good Day To Die Hard. In it, Bruce Willis’ string- vested copper John McClane has to take on the Russkies and prevent nuclear war, etc. But LWLies got a sneak peak inside a top secret Hollywood dossier which contained potential details of McClane’s future adventures...

Title: Die Hard: Bermuda Die-Angle

When his daughter Lucy (played by a misc brunette TV sock puppet) gets engaged to the son of a tax-dodging billionaire Mitteleuropean financier (read: arms dealer) played by Christoph Waltz, irony-heavy Irish moron John McClane – now working as an HR Compliance Officer for Chuck E Cheese – begrudgingly tootles down to Bermuda for the wedding. Sadly, the ceremony soon goes all Kill Bill/November Rain and the bride-to-be is abducted by a platoon of Nazi storm-troopers freshly sprung from the time-dilating netherworld of the Bermuda Triangle. Dutiful to a fault, Bruce manfully smears his semi-naked body with some prototype ‘anti-time gel’ and paraglides into the void with naught but a “Yippee-ki-yay” and some muffled aspersions as to his agent’s parentage. Mayhem ensues.

The supported catalyst formed by the process of this invention comprises the product of a sequence of reaction steps wherein first there occurs in a suitable solvent a reaction between a metallocene and an aluminum alkyl to produce a first reaction product that in turn is reacted with an ionic compound that provides a non-coordinating anion (NCA) to the transition metal of the first reaction product after which the resulting transition metal-NCA reaction product is exposed to a support material that is added to the solvent mixture which then elevated in temperature for a period of time before removal of the solvent to recover the catalyst as a free flowing powder.
The Transition Metal Component of the Catalyst
Any catalytically active transition metal compound is suitable in accordance with the invention, including the known transition metal compounds useful in traditional Ziegler-Natta coordination polymerization and, as well, the metallocene compounds similarly known to be useful in coordination polymerization, when such compounds are capable of catalytic activation by an anionic activator. These will typically include transition metal compounds where the metal is in a d0 oxidation state, that is where the metal has its highest oxidation number, and wherein at least one metal ligand can be protonated by the anionic activator, particularly those ligands including hydride, alkyl and silyl. Ligands capable of protonation and transition metal compounds comprising them include those described in the background art, see for example EP-A-277,003, EP-A-277,004 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,401. Synthesis of these compounds is well known from the published literature.
Additional metallocene compounds appear in the patent literature, for example EP-A-0 129 368, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,871,705, 4,937,299, 5,324,800 EP-A-0-418 044, EP-A-0 591 756, WO-A-92/00333 and WO-A-94/01471.

717,0,21520,3075," valuable. In an online services context, strong perceptions towards online ads provide fertile ground for shoppers to become increasingly price-sensitive (Osakwe and Chovancová [@CR31]). This may be particularly true with regard to the use of price comparison websites. This study, therefore, extends this line of the suggestion by including eSwitching behaviour as an alternative outcome of online ads' perceived usefulness. Consequently, the following hypotheses were developed:*H6: Customers' perceived usefulness of ads positively influences their perception of price comparison websites.H7: Customers' perceived usefulness of ads positively influences their eSwitching behavior.*

The above literature review and proposed hypotheses can be summarized in the theoretical model proposed in Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}. This model extends prior research (e.g. Osakwe and Chovancová [@CR31]) by our assessment of enablers to the perceived use of price comparison websites and eSwitching behavior, especially concerning young and existing online shoppers.Fig. 1.Empirical model

The methodology used to test the proposed model is outlined in the following section.

Empirical Study {#Sec9}
===============

Survey Data and Method {#Sec10}
----------------------

More specifically, student sample was used in the study because this is an important consumer segment for studying online behaviour and has also been extensively employed in the literature (Fan and Suh [@CR12]; Hong [@CR16]; Ozok and Wei [@CR32]; Wu et al. [@CR39]). This study recruited participants from one of the state universities in the Czech Republic using a convenience-based sampling approach which we consider to be most practical in this case. This study uses both online and self-administered surveys, nevertheless, most of the completed responses were from the self-administered questionnaire. Because we wanted to ensure that those who participated in the study have fairly good internet experience with online purchases, in the end -- particularly after deleting responses from six non-online shoppers - we had in total 345 valid responses. Therefore, the empirical focus is on existing online shoppers.

The majority of sample respondents were female (59%), aged between 17--24 (80%), and undergraduates (66%). In this study, statistical analyses were performed using both IBM SPSS and WarpPLS (Kock [@CR22]). Finally, the research constructs - except for demographics - were measured using a five-point scale (ranging from completely disagree to completely agree).

Construct Measurement Validation {#Sec11}
--------------------------------

In order to improve the face and construct validity of the research constructs, constructs were adapted constructs from the literature. In particular, the measures for customer service experience consciousness, perceptions regarding the use of online ads and price comparison websites were based on Osakwe and Chovancová ([@CR31]), while the measure for consumer innovativeness was based on Daghfous et al. ([@CR10]) and finally the measure for eSwitching was modified from Kim et al. ([@CR21]) in addition to reading from the broader literature.

The research hypotheses were tested by using the PLS-path modeling technique and precisely using mode A algorithm. The inspected composite reliability scores were as follows: 0.85 (online ads perceptions/OAD), 0.84 (price comparison websites use/PCWs), 0.80 (shopper innovativeness/INNOV), 0.71 (customer service experience consciousness/CSEC), and 0.74 (eSwitching behavior/eSWITCH). At the same time, all indicator loadings and weights were statistically significant at *p *\< 0.01, besides all the indicator loadings but two exceeded the 0.6 scores required for this kind of exploratory work. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) scores range from 0.59 (OAD), 0.58 (PCW), 0.58 (INNOV), 0.46",847,11,"(CSEC), to 0.49 (eSW"

722,0,20218,0,"It was a huge game — especially considering the season ended last week. After getting its College Football Playoff hopes wrecked at Notre Dame on Week 8, No. 21 USC faced Arizona State on Saturday, hoping to remain in control of at least its conference destiny. A raucous crowd roared on the Sun Devils, as ASU looked to hand the Trojans their second consecutive loss and seize control of the Pac-12 South.

The night — like so many other games this season — began with a whimper at USC’s 25-yard line. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold faked a handoff to junior running back Ronald Jones II but was flushed from the pocket. Darnold danced around the backfield, hesitating to pass twice with no options open, and was pulled down to the turf for a 10-yard loss.

But coming off a 49-14 drubbing in South Bend, the Trojans were in no mood for a rerun of the debacle against Notre Dame. This time, they would wind up on the right side of a 48-17 blowout.

“When you’re trying to win a championship, you have to have one of these victories where you come to another team’s place in a hostile environment and be able to stay in first,” head coach Clay Helton said. “This is what these players and coaches were able to do. I’m extremely proud of them.”

Darnold gave the ball to Jones 15 minutes later — in the opening seconds of the second quarter. Jones exploded through the Sun Devils’ front, then their secondary. A blink and he was across midfield, and then he was gone. Jones pulled up 67 yards later in the end zone. The extra point staked USC a 21-3 cushion. After seemingly playing all season on the back foot, the Trojans were finally dictating the tempo.

“These kids … came out here, they had their jaw set and played some of their best football of the season,” Helton said.

USC regathered quickly after opening the game with a sack. Darnold fired a 12-yard bullet to redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns to move the sticks on third down and found his redshirt freshman receiver again five plays later, firing cross-body while rolling out to his right for a 21-yard catch-and-run. Darnold went for the end zone the very next play, and he dropped a pinpoint pass into junior wideout Deontay Burnett’s outstretched arms. It was the deep shot Trojan fans have rarely seen Darnold execute this season: 32 yards to cap a nine-play, 75-yard drive. For the first time in three weeks, USC got on the board first, racing out to a 7-0 lead.

The two teams traded punts after the opening score, but a blown assignment from sophomore cornerback Jack Jones gifted the Sun Devils 70 yards through the air on their second drive. ASU took advantage with a field goal to cut USC’s lead to four.

But that was as close as the Sun",659,11, Devils would get. After the two sides traded punts

Angela Carter’s Feminist Mythology

The English novelist Angela Carter is best known for her 1979 book “The Bloody Chamber,” which is a kind of updating of the classic European fairy tales. This does not mean that Carter’s Little Red Riding Hood chews gum or rides a motorcycle but that the strange things in those tales—the werewolves and snow maidens, the cobwebbed caves and liquefying mirrors—are made to live again by means of a prose informed by psychoanalysis and cinema and Symbolist poetry. In Carter’s version of “Beauty and the Beast,” retitled “The Tiger’s Bride,” the beast doesn’t change into a beauty. The beauty is changed into a beast, a beautiful one, by means of one of the more memorable sex acts in twentieth-century fiction. At the end of the tale, the heroine is ushered, naked, into the beast’s chamber. He paces back and forth:

I squatted on the wet straw and stretched out my hand. I was now within the field of force of his golden eyes. He growled at the back of his throat, lowered his head, sank on to his forepaws, snarled, showed me his red gullet, his yellow teeth. I never moved. He snuffed the air, as if to smell my fear; he could not.

Slowly, slowly he began to drag his heavy, gleaming weight across the floor towards me.

A tremendous throbbing, as of the engine that makes the earth turn, filled the little room; he had begun to purr....

He dragged himself closer and closer to me, until I felt the harsh velvet of his head against my hand, then a tongue, abrasive as sandpaper. “He will lick the skin off me!”

And each stroke of his tongue ripped off skin after successive skin, all the skins of a life in the world, and left behind a nascent pat",433,11,ina of shiny hairs. My earrings turned back to
725,0,23333,1025," in the Appalachian region of the state, she said. The lessons reached about 200,000 students last year, up from 75,000 before the law passed.

Rayson said that in Tennessee, the energy behind Erin’s Law emerged from the fight against sex trafficking. “But they didn’t look at the ways that public school people are afraid that, knowingly or unknowingly, they might violate the gateway legislation,” she said. “It just gets really fuzzy when you start talking about middle and high school kids. It’s hard to talk about boundaries and safe relationships without wading into something that might not be abstinence before marriage.”

Since the gateway law doesn’t apply to adult learners, it doesn’t interfere with training school staff to recognize and prevent sexual abuse. Still, most school districts don’t require that—except for briefly teaching staff what they are legally required to report to authorities.

“Any good prevention effort is not about liability,” Rayson said. “Policy and procedure is about liability. The goal of prevention should be that no child is ever one-on-one with an adult or another, more powerful kid in a situation that can’t be interrupted or observed.”

Hemmed In

Knox County, which is home to both the largest city in the Appalachian region of the state and to the University of Tennessee, is a good case study in the effects of the gateway law and the slow adoption of Erin’s Law.

Although the state attorney general provided a legal opinion that the gateway law couldn’t be used to fine public health workers invited to speak at schools, in practice, local health departments have mostly stopped speaking to school groups anyway, according to Rayson and local public health officials.

Within the last year, Knox County has begun offering a voluntary training video to educators made by the county health department. The video features local abuse treatment experts explaining how predators operate, why kids don’t tell, and indicators of sexual abuse.

Knox County Schools spokeswoman Carly Harrington said in an email to Rewire that the district encourages all teachers and staff to watch the video, but it’s not required. Knox County Schools teach elementary and middle school students about sexual abuse prevention, she said, although she did not provide any detail about what curriculum is used.

The gateway law is just one symptom of the cultural reluctance to have conversations with young people about sex, a reluctance which has played out publicly in Knox County. Although its teen birth rate doesn’t make sex education mandatory, the school district still teaches it as part of the state’s “family life” curriculum. But at about the same time the gateway law passed, Knox County Schools stopped inviting outside educators to present the lessons, after a parent complained about Planned Parenthood being a presenter.

Instead, the district hired an outside educator to join its staff and handle sex education at all schools that request it—and 90 percent do, Harrington said. The new presenter had previously worked as an abstinence educator for the Christian-based “Just Wait” program, and many portions of his presentation remained unchanged.

In the following years, some parents and students complained that the presentation placed the responsibility for abstinence on women, downplayed the effectiveness of birth control and condom use, and used degrading language about women paired with sexist jokes.

Two years ago, several female graduates of a district high school started a critical group called “Just Educate,” which conducted an online student survey and made a film of students expressing their criticisms of Knox County’s approach to sex education. In Just Educate’s (admittedly unscientific) voluntary survey of 210 students, 64 percent described the sex education unit as “completely negative” and 36 percent reported feeling targeted or blamed by the educator.

Harrington has stated in emails that the presentation is regularly reviewed by a school district supervisor and has never been found to contain any inappropriate content.

Just Educate leaders met with school district officials about their concerns, but little changed. Several parents saw the Just Wait campaign and chimed in last year, meeting with district officials about their concerns and asking that students be given a formal survey after the presentation to gauge its effectiveness. Knox County Schools piloted this with teachers and",906,11, a small group of middle school students in spring. Results

In Brown v. State, supra, it was held that the trial court should have allowed testimony showing the general reputation of the prosecutrix for unchastity, but it was not held that defendant could inquire into the question of specific acts of intercourse with third persons. One reason for refusal to allow such an inquiry is stated in Stone v. State, supra, [2, 3] as follows:
""... The basis of such rule, we take it, is the same as in other cases, the unwisdom of opening the door to collateral issues tending rather to hinder than promote justice....""
We can think of no type of case in which the reason for the rule could be more persuasive than in this case, in which commendable fidelity on the part of the prosecutrix to her ex-husband and on the part of him to her and on the part of both to their children was displayed.
In the closing argument of the State the following occurred:
""MR. TUCKER: She testified she did not willingly submit to this but that everything done there was because she was afraid for her own safety and the safety of her children.
""MR. MOSES: We object to that. There is no evidence of that in the testimony.
""THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, either lawyer can argue any inference of what they draw from the evidence. What they say in the case is not evidence. Ladies and gentlemen, you have listened to it, make up your own minds *744 what the evidence is; so I will overrule the objection with that admonition.""
Appellant urges that the action of the trial court in this particular respect was erroneous. We do not agree.

It took some time to discover the world of non-kit lenses and bokeh. That opened the door to buying fast m4/3 primes with great auto focus. Then came the DRTV videos. The allure of full frame bokeh. And the general impression from Kai Wong that a 5Diii is pretty portable and can easily be toted around with one hand. It fed my dissatisfaction with E-M5 since I always felt that the E-M5 wasn't as portable as it could be, especially with anything other than the 17mm f1.8 or 20mm f1.7. Definitely not so much with the hand grip, or the 12-40mm f2.8. So why not try out a FF DSLR and see how it goes?

Well, I bought a used 5Diii instead of an imported D750, picked up a sweet Sigma 50mm f1.4 and went to town!

No Like:
1. The 5Diii + Sigma 50 is a monster to hold. It's ENORMOUS. And it's not even the biggest 50mm out there! The Canon 50/1.4 and the Sigma ART are both even bigger and heavier! Often I find myself cradling the beast like a newborn baby just to get my keys out of my pocket! No like.
2. Razor thin DOF is over rated. In fact I find it really distracting now. I can't stand shooting with the Sigma wide open. It has noticeable glow wide open, and I generally have to shoot between f2.8 and f4 just to get my subjects in focus. No like.
3. Stopping down the aperture often means boosting ISO. No likey. Kinda. But in reality the 5D's noise is acceptable up to 10,000. Whereas I on the E-M5 I shoot 6400 only when I'm desperate.
4. The ISO thing wouldn't be so much of an issue if i didn't have to keep my shutter speeds above 1/125 or 1/160 to get a sharp image. Either I have shakey hands, bad mirror slap, or I've just become spoiled with 5-Axis IBIS. No likey.
5. AF. While AF is quick and C-AF is leaps and bounds better than the E-M5, because of the shallow DOF, I find myself obsessively refocusing before every shutter release. It may not really be necessary, and my confidence may improve with use, but right now it's psychologically burdensome.
6. Strobes. Stopping down the aperture for DOF means boosting your strobe power. no like. I've also been spoiled by the Olympus RC Flash control.

731,0,26400,0,"Product-form solution

In probability theory, a product-form solution is a particularly efficient form of solution for determining some metric of a system with distinct sub-components, where the metric for the collection of components can be written as a product of the metric across the different components. Using capital Pi notation a product-form solution has algebraic form

where B is some constant. Solutions of this form are of interest as they are computationally inexpensive to evaluate for large values of n. Such solutions in queueing networks are important for finding performance metrics in models of multiprogrammed and time-shared computer systems.

Equilibrium distributions

The first product-form solutions were found for equilibrium distributions of Markov chains. Trivially, models composed of two or more independent sub-components exhibit a product-form solution by the definition of independence. Initially the term was used in queueing networks where the sub-components would be individual queues. For example, Jackson's theorem gives the joint equilibrium distribution of an open queueing network as the product of the equilibrium distributions of the individual queues. After numerous extensions, chiefly the BCMP network it was thought local balance was a requirement for a product-form solution.

Gelenbe's G-network model was the first to show that this is not the case. Motivated by the need to model biological neurons which have a point-process like spiking behaviour, he introduced the precursor of G-Networks, calling it the random neural network. By introducing  ""negative customers"" which can destroy or eliminate other customers, he generalised the family of product form networks. Then this was further extended in several steps, first by Gelenbe's ""triggers"" which are customers which have the power of moving other customers from some queue to another. Another new form of customer that also led to product form was Gelenbe's ""batch removal"". This was further extended by  Erol Gelenbe and Jean-Michel Fourneau with customer types called ""resets"" which can model the repair of failures: when a queue hits the empty state, representing (for instance) a failure, the queue length can jump back or be ""reset"" to its steady-state distribution by an arriving reset customer, representing a repair. All these previous types of customers in G-Networks can exist in the same network, including with multiple classes, and they all together still result in the product form solution, taking us far beyond the reversible networks that had been considered before.

Product-form solutions are sometimes described as ""stations are independent in equilibrium"". Product form solutions also exist in networks of bulk queues.

J.M. Harrison and R.J. Williams note that ""virtually all of the models that have been successfully analyzed in classical queueing network theory are models having a so-called product-form stationary distribution"" More recently, product-form solutions have been published for Markov process algebras (e.g. RCAT in PEPA) and stochastic petri nets. Martin Feinberg's deficiency zero theorem gives a sufficient condition for chemical reaction networks to exhibit a product-form stationary distribution.

The work by Gelenbe also shows that product form G-Networks can be used to model spiking random neural networks, and furthermore that such networks can be used to approximate bounded and continuous real-valued functions.

733,0,29658,0,"Investing In Property: 3 Underrated Factors That Can Make Or Break Your Investment That Agents Won’t Tell You

In recent weeks, there has been renewed interest in Singapore’s residential property market. For many property investors, this is welcomed news after several years of stagnating property prices on the back of up to 9 rounds of property cooling measures since 2009.

If you’re considering getting into the property investing game to earn passive income or start building your wealth, congratulations on taking actions towards a worthy aspiration. However, there many things you have to consider. For instance, you have to take into account downpayments, stamp duty, ABSD payments, renovation cost, agent fees, insurance, maintenance fees, taxes, insurance and so many more expense items that will impact your returns from your investment.

Beyond these usual cost items, there are features about the property that can affect its value over the long term. We cover three lesser known factors that your property agent won’t tell you about but can substantially affect your property value.

#1 Your Neighbours

During your property viewing, you would most likely be concerned with the layout of the home, the renovation works and view you get. Many people fail to even think about how neighbours can actually affect your property’s value or make it an undesirable home to live in.

The first thing you need to look at is the physical condition of your neighbour’s property. There are some red flags that you can look out for and preventive measures you need to observe to ensure you don’t fall into such a trap.

One such cause for concern could be seeing many clothing lines outside the property. This could mean there are many people living in that property, which could make it a (illegal) dormitory of sorts for foreign workers. While this is not a bad thing itself, it may become a problem if there are several of these types of homes in the estate. Apart from being unsightly, many renters, especially with young families, may also prefer not to live in such environments as they may perceive it to be less safe.

Another red flag could be seeing several plants or other equipment that are just on the borderline of infringing on the “space” of the property you are looking at. This could very well mean that you will likely be dealing with a neighbour who may cause unnecessary nuisances.

Even if you live a few doors away or on another floor, if your neighbours end up in the newspapers for such trouble, your property could get a bad reputation which can affect how much people are willing to pay for it even if the banks will give you a fair valuation.

Another thing you should look out for is the noise level. You may need to come back for separate viewings during different times of the day to listen out for this or canvass the estate yourself during different hours of the day and time of the week.

Besides these, neighbours who run into financial problems and are harassed by debt collectors (especially the illegal ones) or are forced by the bank into foreclosure may affect the value of your home. Homes that have also been the subject of crimes or next to those that are could see their values affected as well. These are hard to discern, although your agent or the current homeowner would definitely have inside information regarding this.

736,0,21603,0,"Taking the same well-known flea drugs commonly given to dogs and cats could protect humans against mosquitoes carrying malaria, Zika and other diseases, a new study suggests. They could also protect us from sand flies bearing the tropical disease leishmaniasis

A class of drugs called isoxazolines, if given to less than a third of the population in areas prone to outbreaks of insect-borne diseases, could prevent up to 97% of all cases of infection, according to research published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Isoxazolines are contained in the veterinary products fluralaner (Bravecto) and afoxolaner (NexGard), which protect pets from fleas and ticks. An animal's bloodstream absorbs these medicines, which are given orally, and spreads them throughout the body. The drugs, which remain active for up to three months, kill blood-sucking fleas and ticks.

In humans, a single dose of the medicine might also act as an insecticide effective against mosquitoes and sand flies for between 50 and 90 days, say the collaborating scientists from Calibr, a nonprofit drug discovery institute affiliated with Scripps Research, and TropIQ Health Sciences, an international entrepreneurial enterprise based in the Netherlands. The drugs also were effective against insect strains that are resistant to common insecticides, the researchers say.

The scientists, whose work is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, admit to not testing their theories on actual people but say they've conducted experimental studies on mosquitoes and based their calculations on research on Isoxazolines in animals.

Still, give them points for creativity; this is an entirely new strategy for an ancient problem: warding off mosquito- and fly- borne illnesses that sicken millions of people worldwide each year.

A few other unproven and unusual methods for killing mosquitoes are also on the horizon.

Insect zapping fence

Intellectual Ventures, an advanced technology solutions company, has combined software, sensors and lasers to create an elaborate weapon against mosquitoes: the Photonic Fence

The virtual fence essentially shoots down pests passing within a kill zone that extends as far as 98 feet (30 meters) horizontally and 10 feet (3 meters) vertically. Specifically, it targets mosquitoes, fruit flies and Asian citrus psyllids, an insect that infects and destroys citrus trees.

The photonic fence works by first detecting, through sensors, a passing insect and then measuring its wing beat frequency, shape, size and airspeed in order to avoid confusing a mosquito with, say, a butterfly or a bumblebee. The fence's internal software system can even discriminate between male and female mosquitoes, since only the females bite humans (and so would need to be destroyed).

Once it decides that a passing insect is a fair target, the fence trains an invisible, infrared laser on it and delivers just enough photonic energy to stop the winged creature midflight. The system, which does not endanger humans or animals, is calibrated to destroy its prey using the least amount of energy possible and so can run on solar power.

Having created its third prototype, Intellectual Ventures believes that the photonic fence is a way to fight malaria and other mosquito-borne health threats while posing an environmentally responsible alternative to the chemical pesticides used in contemporary agriculture.

Gene editing

With the development of the gene editing tool known as CRISPR (or ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats""), scientists have begun to experiment with mutating targeted genes in disease-causing mosquitoes. Various techniques are being developed, a scientific review indicates.

Just last year, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District released thousands of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying a lethal gene on Stock Island in an ongoing field trial. Although only the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bite and spread disease to humans, scientists had chosen to genetically modified the males in such a way that they could still mate with the females, yet any resulting larvae would die before maturity.

The hoped-for result in Florida is an eliminated or at least reduced population of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and the viruses they spread. (The district has not announced results from this trial run.)

Scientists are also looking at other ways to disrupt the Aedes aegypti mosquito genome, which is about a third the size of the human genome

I was able to use one to read in an 8 bit parallel bus at around 8MHz without
having to build a separate board with appropriate MCU.

Had a quick scroll through the docs there, thanks for the link! One thing
that's not clear to me is the degree to which the PRU has register-controller
peripheral modules like an MCU, or are you essentially bit-banging everything
(which definitely has its appeal after the hours you can spend wrangling with
the stupid timers and DMAs on a CM3).

How is the community? Are there ready to go modules for common tasks like
actively rectified H-bridge control, CANbus control, etc? (I know the
processor itself can do CAN too, but say I have a hard realtime requirement on
my CAN network...)

It is basically a raw MCU without any peripherals. I think the main purpose is
so you can implement just about any basic peripheral and novel ideas in code,
so it is essentially a bit bang but like most MCUs you can read/set an entire
IO bank in one go. Since it is separate and basically deterministic except for
some ram latency jitter whatever you implement that works should be as solid
as any purpose built peripheral. It takes some assembly though. It is
absolutely great for basic IO stuff that an arduino class MCU could do where
the bandwidth is too high for dealing with the GPIOs with standard linux
scheduler latency.

I played with it a couple years ago and the community appeared small, but it
is straight forward enough that the examples and docs are likely all you need.
I bet the community is stronger but it isn't going to be on stack exchange.

Yeah, they are excellent for bit-banging protocols, which is really handy if
you come across some weird digital interface. I've used it for interfacing
with a scanner head, which is a fairly quirky parallel interface.

Mr. Karl F. Krueger
Danzas AEI Customs Brokerage Services
29200 Northwestern Highway
Southfield, MI 48034RE: COUNTRY OF ORIGIN MARKING OF IMPORTED NYLON ROLLERS
Dear Mr. Krueger:
This is in response to your letter dated January 7, 2002, on behalf of Canimex requesting a ruling on whether it is acceptable to mark the container in which imported nylon rollers, made in China, are repackaged in the U.S. or Canada with the words “Made in Canada” or “Made in USA.” A marked sample in a blister pack was submitted with your letter for review.
The article consists of a blister pack containing two nylon rollers with metal shafts used on garage doors. The rollers, which are individually marked “China”, are sent in bulk to either the USA or Canada to be repackaged. The sample you supplied has a package that is marked “Made in USA” on the front. The rear of the package has the importers address in the United States.
The marking statute, section 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), provides that, unless excepted, every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the U.S. shall be marked in a conspicuous place as legibly, indelibly and permanently as the nature of the article (or its container) will permit, in such a manner as to indicate to the ultimate purchaser in the U.S. the English name of the country of origin of the article. Part 134, Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. Part 134), implements the country of origin marking requirements and exceptions of 19 U.S.C. §1304. ""Country of origin"" is defined in section 134.1(b), Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. §134.1(b)), as
The country of manufacture, production, or growth of any article of foreign origin entering the United States. Further work or material added to an article in another country must effect a substantial transformation in order to render such other country the ""country of origin"" within the meaning of this part.
Section 134.1(d), Customs Regulations (19 C.F.R. §134.1(d)) provides that:
The ‘ultimate purchaser’ is generally the last person in the United States who will receive the article in the form in which it was imported; however, for a good of a NAFTA country, the ‘ultimate purchaser’ is the last person in the United States who purchases the good in the form in which it was imported.
In this case, the rollers are wholly obtained or produced in China, and undergo only minor processing (repackaging) in the United States or Canada. Under the principle set forth in U.S. v. Gibson-Thomsen Co., Inc., 27 CCPA 269 (1940), if an imported article will be used in domestic manufacture, the manufacturer may be the ""ultimate purchaser"" if he subjects the imported article to a process which results in a substantial transformation of the article. A substantial transformation occurs “when an article emerges from a process with a new name, character, or use different from that possessed by the article prior to processing.” See Texas Instruments, Inc. v. United States, 69 C.C.P.A. 152, 681 F.2d 778 (1982) (cited with approval in Torrington Co. v. United States, 764 F. 2d 1563, 1568 (1985)).
In determining whether the processing operations constitute a substantial transformation, the issue is the extent of operations performed and",816,11, whether the parts lose their identity and become an integral part

abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a new weight initialization method called [*even initialization*]{} for wide and deep nonlinear neural networks with the ReLU activation function. We prove that no poor local minimum exists in the initial loss landscape in the wide and deep nonlinear neural network initialized by the even initialization method that we propose. Specifically, in the initial loss landscape of such a wide and deep ReLU neural network model, the following four statements hold true: 1) the loss function is non-convex and non-concave; 2) every local minimum is a global minimum; 3) every critical point that is not a global minimum is a saddle point; and 4) bad saddle points exist. We also show that the weight values initialized by the even initialization method are contained in those initialized by both of the (often used) standard initialization and He initialization methods.'

With Promarkers it is easy to get smooth areas of colors, and by mixing colors while the ink is still wet, you can make wonderful nuances and shadows on your images. The choice og card stock is different from person to person, you have to find which one you like best. I use mostly aquarell papers. Be aware that the ink is spreading more on aquarell paper, and the sough surface can wear out the tip of the marker. Among ink pads I recommend Adirondack Dye. It is the very best ink pad to use with Promarkers. Other ink will very easily smudge into the markers and ruin the image. Let the Adirondacken dry for a couple of hours before you start coloring in. You can also use Distress ink pads, that works as a charm too.

747,0,21845,0,"The Zig Zag Wrasse- a New Sporadic Cleaner Wrasse Found

The Zig Zag wrasse, Halichoeres scapularis is a species of wrasse which grows to approximately 20 centimeters in length. There is little literature on these fish and they do not appear to have been studied in any detail. They have recently been noted to exhibit sporadic cleaning behavior.

APPEARANCE

As with many wrasses, they are protogynous hermaphrodites and start life as females with the potential to turn into males later in life. As a juvenile and a female, the zigzag wrasse has a white background coloration with a black or yellow or a black and yellow stripe zigzagging along the body. The area above the stripe has a slight bluish tint.

As a mature male the coloration is quite different, the background color is a very light bluish green sheen and the yellow or black line generally disappears and goes purple. The caudal fin is yellowish and the body is over laid with pinkish marks across the body and horizontal lines across the face. The dorsal fin has horizontal pink stripes over a yellowish color and the anal fin is yellowish with a pink line. The eye is an orange color.

HABITAT

The zig zag wrasse occurs in tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific area. The fish inhabits lagoons and seaward reefs and is most commonly seen searching over sandy and rubble filled areas alongside the reef although it has also been observed swimming across grass beds. It occurs mainly singly but can be seen in groups.

DIET

The zig zag wrasse forages singly or in groups for benthic crustaceans and they are commonly seen swimming across rubble near the reef and at times over the reef its self.

SPECIALISED BEHAVIOUR NOTED AMONG FEMALES IN TANZANIA

At Njau Gap on Pemba Island in 2014 we first noticed two of these wrasses cleaning two arabian spinecheeks Scolopsis ghanam. The individuals cleaning were both females as can be seen in the images. Similar behavior has been noted in Brazil with Halichoeres penrosei which has been described as a sporadic cleaner wrasse. Halichoeres scapularis bears quite a physical resemblance to Halichoeres penrosei

Subsequently when diving in Dar es Salaam and Mafia Island in Tanzania we have observed the same behavior and interestingly have on several occasions seen the females performing a similar dance to that of the blue stripe cleaner wrasse, dipping their tail up and down. The dance seems more of an impromptu action compared to the blue streak cleaner, Labroides dimidiatus and the bi color cleaner Labroides bicolor which both set up specific cleaning stations around coral bommies.

The juvenile zig zag wrasse does not seem to be as territorial as the Labroides species and seems to do its dance whenever it sees a potential “client” that it wants to clean and on occasion dances for a diver whereas the Labroides species are generally tied to a specific spot. To date we have not observed any terminal males doing any cleaning and possibly this is only performed by the females. We do have some fairly poor quality video of a fish exhibiting this dance should anyone wish to see it. It is however interesting that it uses the same behavior as Labroides to attract “clients”.

As an experiment we placed some bait near Halichoeres scapularis and it vigorously ate it, whereas the same bait placed near Labroides dimidiatus elicited no response. Certainly the fish is a sporadic cleaner.

The images above and below show a juvenile Zigzag Wrasse cleaning an Arabian Monacle Bream (Scolopsis ghanam)

REPRODUCTION

Zig zag wrasses are pelagic spawners.

AQUARIUMS

The zig zag wrasse is not commonly kept in aquariums. They would make an ideal fish for beginners as they are tough fish but would very likely be territorial. Sometimes on a big spring tide they can be seen stranded in rock pools with the water temperature over 35 C. They are voracious eaters of any meat bait put out and would be very easy to feed. They are a fairly attractive looking fish as well.

748,0,24434,2050,"cdF(G)\}.$$ Together with Theorem \[thm:MMain\], this yields the following. Here as before $\mathcal F$ is the collection of all the conjugates of $\{P_\lambda\}$, all their subgroups, and all finite subgroups of $G$.

Let $G$ be relatively hyperbolic. Then $\cdF(G)$ is finite.

The *homological Dehn function* $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_X(k)$ of a simply-connected cell complex $X$ measures the difficulty of filling cellular $1$-cycles with $2$-chains. For a finitely presented group $G$ and $X$ a model for $EG$ with $G$-cocompact $2$-skeleton, the growth rate of $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_{G}(k):=\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_X(k)$ is a group invariant [@Fl98 Theorem 2.1]. The function $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_G(k)$ can also be defined from algebraic considerations under the weaker assumption that $G$ is $FP_2$, see [@HaMa15 Section 3]. Analogously, for a group $G$ and a family of subgroups $\mc F$ with a cocompact model for $E_{\mc F}G$, there is relative homological Dehn function $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_{G,\mc F}(k)$ whose growth rate is an invariant of the pair $(G, \mc F)$, see [@MP15-2 Theorem 4.5].

Gersten proved that a group $G$ is hyperbolic if and only if it is $FP_2$ and the growth rate of $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_G(k)$ is linear [@Ge96 Theorem 5.2]. An analogous characterisation for relatively hyperbolic groups is proved in [@MP15-2 Theorem 1.11] relying on the following corollary. We remark that a converse of Corollary \[thm:char\] requires an additional condition that $\{P_\lambda\}$ is an almost malnormal collection, see [@MP15-2 Theorem 1.11(1) and Remark 1.13].

\[thm:char\] Let $G$ be relatively hyperbolic. Then $G$ is $FP_{2, \mc F}$ and $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_{G, \mc F}(k)$ has linear growth.

The existence of a cocompact model $X=\Gamma^\blacktriangle_n$ for $E_{\mc F}(G)$ implies that $G$ is $FP_{2,\mc F}$. Since $X$ has fine and hyperbolic $1$-skeleton and has finite edge $G$-stabilisers, it follows that $\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_{G,\mc F}(k):=\operatorname{\mathsf{FV}}_X(k)$ has linear growth by [@MP15 Theorem",745,11," 1.7].

1. Tile backsplash feature wall. Attention-grabbing backsplash tile is nothing new in well-designed kitchens. But what many professionals on Houzz are seeing more of lately is an interest in taking tile from countertop to ceiling, even behind floating shelves and range hoods, to create an eye-catching feature wall.

2. Glass and steel room dividers. In recent years, we've seen increased popularity in glass and steel for front doors and shower enclosures on Houzz. But good ideas spread quickly. We're seeing more glass and steel dividers between interior rooms and expect that to continue in 2019. They give an open feeling while still providing some privacy and noise control, along with a stylish graphic element or contrasting color to otherwise white walls.

3. Destination tub. Our Bathroom Trends Report has shown that homeowners debate whether to keep a bathtub following a remodel. But it’s clear that those who enjoy taking baths really enjoy taking baths. Couple that with people spending more to increase the size of their bathroom and create a spa-like environment and you’ve got some homeowners who aren’t just keeping the tub, they’re celebrating it.

4. Black is back. Black isn't a stranger to kitchen design, but we're seeing our community embrace a heavy dose of dramatic color in kitchens. Large swaths of black range hoods, island accent colors and full-on all-black cabinetry have been popping up in the most popular photos on Houzz. In 2019, we'll see black cabinets paired with white walls, backsplash and countertops for a dynamic and sophisticated contrast.

5. Dark and moody colors. As with kitchen cabinets, the dark side is expanding its force in other areas of the home, as well. Color experts think it’s a reaction to all the whites and bright colors that have long shown favor. Deeper, moodier colors like navy, black and forest greens will win over homeowners in 2019.

6. Furniture benches in the dining area. Built-in bench seating in a dining nook off a kitchen is highly prized for its comfiness and extra storage. We’re also seeing the Houzz community bring in bench furniture pieces, which offer an affordable and convenient alternative. It turns almost any dining spot into more of a lounge area, and you can tuck a few storage baskets underneath for blankets, games, place settings and more, giving you the feeling of a banquette without the commitment.

7. Board and batten exterior. The modern farmhouse look is still going strong throughout the home but exteriors are also seeing some of that throwback love. The board and batten method of construction delivers that homey look and adds texture and interest to what might otherwise be a flat facade.

8. Kitchens that open to the outdoors. Our Kitchen Trends Report found homeowners are increasingly opening their kitchens to the outdoors with exterior double doors. With more homeowners calling the kitchen the hub of the home these days, they look to outdoor areas to expand living space.

5\. Iterate Steps 2-4 *K*times, where *K*is determined via cross validation.

### Remarks

The above two approaches use thresholding for regularized estimation and feature selection. Specifically, at each iteration, the gradients, which measure the relative importance of representative features, are computed. More important representative features tend to have larger gradients. Only the important representative features are selected, and their estimated regression coefficients are updated. The iteration stops when a cross validation-based criterion is reached. The second algorithm ensures that, if a second-order term is selected, its corresponding first-order terms are selected. This cannot be automatically achieved with the first algorithm. We refer to \[[@B17]\] for a more detailed discussion of thresholding regularization. Both approaches involve tuning parameters *τ*and *K*, which are selected using V-fold cross validation. In data analysis, we set *V*= 5 and search over *τ*= 1.0, 0.95, 0.9, \..., 0.05, 0. Research code written in R is available at <http://www.med.yale.edu/eph/faculty/labs/ma/> for the construction of network modules and representative features and regularized estimation.

[**Abstract.**]{} Let $f$ be a multivariate density and $f_n$ be a kernel estimate of $f$ drawn from the $n$-sample $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ of i.i.d. random variables with density $f$. We compute the asymptotic rate of convergence towards 0 of the volume of the symmetric difference between the $t$-level set $\{f\geq t\}$ and its plug-in estimator $\{f_n\geq t\}$. As a corollary, we obtain the exact rate of convergence of a plug-in type estimate of the density level set corresponding to a fixed probability for the law induced by $f$.

[**Key-words:**]{} Kernel estimate, Density level sets, Hausdorff measure.

[**1. Introduction.**]{} Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in estimation of density level sets and in related multivariate mappings problems. The main reason is the recent advent of powerfull mathematical tools and computational machinery that render these problems much more tractable. One of the most powerful application of density level sets estimation is in unsupervised [*cluster analysis*]{} (see Hartigan \[1\]), where one tries to break a complex data set into a series of piecewise similar groups or structures, each of which may then be regarded as a separate class of data, thus reducing overall data compexity. But there are many other fields where the knowledge of density level sets is of great interest. For example, Devroye and Wise \[2\], Grenander \[3\], Cuevas \[4\] and Cuevas and Fraiman \[5\] used density support estimation for pattern recognition and for detection of the abnormal behavior of a system.

In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the $t$-level set ${\cal L}(t)$ of a multivariate probability density $f$ with support in ${I\!\!R}^k$ from independent random variables $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ with density $f$. Recall that for $t\geq 0$, the $t$-level set of the density $f$ is defined as follows : $${\cal L}(t)=\{x\in{I\!\!R}^k\, :\, f(x)\geq t\}.$$

The question now is how to define the estimates of ${{\cal L}}(t)$ from the $n$-sample $X_1,\cdots,X_n$? Even in a nonparametric framework, there are many possible answers to this question, depending on the restrictions one can impose on the level set and the density under study. Mainly, there are two families of such estimators : the [*plug-in*]{} estimators and the estimators constructed by an [*excess mass*]{} approach. Assume that an estimator $f_n$ of the density $f$ is available. Then a straightforward estimator of the level set ${{\cal L}}(t)$ is $\{f_n\geq t\}$, the plug-in estimator. Molchanov \[6, 7\] and Cuevas and Fraiman \[5\] proved consistency of these estimators and obtained some rates of convergence. The excess mass approach suggest to first consider the empirical mapping $M_n$ defined for every borel set $L\subset{I\!\!R}^k$ by $$M_n(L)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n {\bf 1}_{\{X_i\in L\}}-t \lambda(L),$$ where $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure on ${I\!\!R}^k$. A natural estimator of ${{\cal L}}(t)$ is a maximizer of $M_n(L)$ over a given class of",979,11, borel sets $L$. For different classes of level

756,0,26559,0,"A “model” generally describes one or more complex application artifacts (e.g., business processes, data structures, structure and behavior of software systems or other technical and/or business components, etc.) in a formalized fashion. A model can use modeling primitives and/or conventions of a well-defined “abstract language,” which oftentimes is referred to as a metamodel. Some common metamodels are the UML family of modeling languages (e.g., UML class diagrams, UML collaboration diagrams, etc.), the BPMN metamodel, the ARTS family of modeling languages (EPC, VAC, FAD, etc.), the entity-relationship (meta)model (ERM), the relational (meta)model, etc. A metamodel, being an abstract language, may be thought of as a collection of modeling elements that can be used or “instantiated” to describe the actual models. For instance, in a UML class diagram, modeling elements include classes, associations, properties, etc., whereas the model elements in the relational model include relations and their attributes. These modeling elements can be arranged in a variety of well-defined ways to build formal models representing potentially complex business and/or technical processing or other flows.
A metamodel is in principle independent of a concrete notation and therefore may be thought of as an “abstract language,” as indicated above. For instance, a metamodel may define only the language concepts and the rules for their use to form a valid model for the metamodel itself. To do actual modeling with a metamodel, however, a concrete notation is required. Notations of metamodel elements include, for example, boxes with three “compartments” that represent UML classes, labeled rectangles and diamonds used to represent entities and relationships in the ERM, etc.
A common trait of many metamodels is that corresponding models can be represented as a graph including nodes and edges, which collectively can be referred to as the graph's “elements.” Computer systems handling different “kinds” of models (e.g., so-called model management systems) often use some kind of graph model as internal representation for all kinds of models.
Model merging involves creating a single merged result model C, from two models A and B (where A, B, and C can be expressed in the same metamodel), that possibly describe the same or overlapping sets of application artifacts (e.g., the same software system, the same business process, etc.), but describe these artifacts differently. For example, A and B could be two versions of the same original model that were modified independently. As another example, A and B might describe different aspects of an application domain that share some overlap.
It would be desirable to run a merge function to deliver a merged model C that does not contain redundancies. That is, it would be desirable to help ensure that all model elements that appear in both A and B appear at most once in the merged model C. Depending on the exact purpose of C, it oftentimes is desirable to preserve all elements that are either in A or B. Doing so may help to reduce the likelihood of information being lost from the input models. However, this is not a general requirement for merging. It also would be desirable to have the merged model C be consistent and well formed, e.g., so that it meets the constraints of its respective metamodel.
With models being some kind of graphs, model merging is a different challenge than the more common (and usually line-wise) merging of text files as it is done, e.g., in version control systems. Text-based merging of models is theoretically possible if there is a textual (e.g., XML-based) notation for their respective metamodel. However, text-based merge tools are not natural tools for handling the merging of models. For example, most textual representations are ill-suited for direct use by humans and are only meant as storage formats or for model interchange. In particular, the structure of the (linear) textual representations usually differs considerably from the non-linear, graph-",884,11,"like structure of the model itself, making it difficult and"

For Percy, it could be an act to try and feel important when he lives in a super large family who just doesn’t seem to appreciate him the way he would like. For Moody, it could be a real mental issues (paranoia and PTSD) triggered by his years of work putting wizarding criminals in Azkaban.

No matter what the story, the underlining premise of all of this is to just be kind to people. Don’t talk crap about them, don’t be curt when they ask for your help, just be nice. You never know what battle someone else is fighting or has already won/lost. So be kind.

I waited to write this blog because so much in my life had taken over in getting ready to move and getting ready for school to start. I’m happy I did too. The themes I pulled out of these two chapters include Patience and Understanding, and Forgiveness v. Revenge. Looking at the state of the world today, with the whole Charlottesville hate march this weekend its hard to have any feelings except either anger or despair. For me, I just don’t understand how there can be people who truly believe that the white race is and should be the only ones to hold power. What kind of world do we live in that people still actually believe one race, one type of people is better than a diverse mixture of backgrounds, traditions, and cultures. I truly wanted to believe that our world was different, or at least our country was different, but this past year, this past year has shown us, we haven’t come as far aw we hoped.

These two chapters of Harry Potter have a lot of dialogue. We and out Lupin, Sirius, Peter Pettigrew, and James Potter were the creators of the Marauders Map and best friends at Hogwarts. We find out Peter is indeed alive and has been Ron’s rat this whole time. We find out that Sirius wasn’t the exact reason for Lily and James’ death, but that it was Peter. We see Snape’s grudge fully turn into a desire for revenge and we see everyone arguing over the events of the past 11-12 years. There is fighting, there is reconciliation and forgiveness, there is trust and hope, there is tinge of justice and understanding.

They say there are always two sides to a story. Sometimes either side of the story is the actual truth to the person telling it. Whether it’s exactly what happened doesn’t always matter because to that person it’s the internalized truth of them, it’s their story. Sometimes either side of the story is a complete fabrication, a lie to make the person look or seem better than they are. It’s a story that distorts the truth to change the perception of those listening.

Peter Pettigrew, his friends most dire secret keeper, wanted power, craved attention and gave away his friends hiding spot resulting in their murder and the orphaning of Harry Potter. It also took all of his master’s power away and in turn made him the enemy of many Voldemort followers. Instead of meeting the wrath of Sirius Black who wanted revenge for his friends’ deaths, Peter took the lives of innocent muggles and framed Sirius to be the culprit. Peter faked his death and went into hiding to cover his tracks only to be found many years later by the man he framed.

Revenge consumed Sirius Black in Azkaban. The thought of finding Pettigrew, of actually killing him this time took over Sirius Black’s mind. Sirius didn’t care about justice, about taking back his freedom for a death he was wrongfully accused of, he on;y cared about actually killing Peter this time. His narrative would always be controlled by the desire to avenge the death of",822,11," his friends no matter the consequences.

During course delivery, I usually work every single exercise from
scratch, without looking at the solution, on my computer while the
students also work.  For this, I strongly advise you to have a printed
copy of the exercises on hand that you can look at without having to
pull it up on the computer screen (which is being projected).  Near
the end of the exercise time period, I will start discussing my
solution code, emphasizes different bits on the screen and talking
about them.  If there are any potential problems with the solution
(including design considerations), I’ll also talk about it.  Emphasize
to students that they may want to look at/copy solution code before
going forward.

## Section 1:  Introduction

The major goal of this section is to get people started with the
environment.  This includes using the interactive shell and
editing/run short programs.  By the end of the section, students
should be able to write short scripts that read data files and perform
small calculations.  They will know about numbers, strings, lists, and
files.  There will also be some exposure to functions, exceptions, and
modules, but a lot of details will be missing.

The first part of this course is often the longest because students
are new to the tools and may have various problems getting things to
work.  It is absolutely critical that you go around the room and make
sure that everyone can edit, run, and debug simple programs.  Make
sure Python is installed correctly.  Make sure they have the course
exercises downloaded.  Make sure the internet works.  Fix anything
else that comes up.

Timing: I aim to finish section 1 around lunch on the first day. 

## Section 2 : Working with Data

This section is probably the most important in the course.  It covers
the basics of data representation and manipulation including tuples,
lists, dicts, and sets.

Section 2.2 the most important.  Give students as much time as
they need to get exercises working within reason.  Depending on audience,
the exercises might last 45 minutes.  In the middle of this exercise,
I will often move forward to Section 2.3 (formatted printing) and
give students more time to keep working.  Together, Sections 2.2/2.3
might take an hour or more.

Section 2.4 has people explore the use of enumerate(), and zip().  I
consider these functions essential so don’t skimp on it.

Section 2.5 introduces the collections module.  There is a LOT that
could be said about collections, but it won't be fully appreciated by
students at this time.  Approach this more from the standpoint of
""here's this cool module you should look at later. Here are a few cool
examples.""

Section 2.6 introduces list comprehensions which are an important
feature for processing list data.  Emphasize to students that list
comprehensions are very similar to things like SQL database queries.
At the end of this exercise, I often do an interactive demo involving
something more advanced.  Maybe do a list comprehension and plot some
data with matplotlib.  Also an opportunity to introduce Jupyter if
you're so inclined.

Section 2.7 is the most sophisticated exercise.  It relates to the use
of first-class data in Python and the fact that data structures like
lists can hold any kind of object that you want.  The exercises are
related to parsing columns of data in CSV files and concepts are later reused in
Section 3.2.

Timing: Ideally, you want to be done with section 2 on the first day.
However, it is common to finish with",825,11, section 2.5 or 2.6.  So

Congressional Republicans want to pass a tax bill by Thanksgiving, and President Trump wants to sign it by Christmas. Right in the middle of that stretch lies the Dec. 8 deadline to pass legislation funding the government.

If Republicans and Democrats can't agree to a new spending plan, or at least a stopgap measure that Democrats say they don't want, the government will shut down.

Complicating things further, even a short-term deal to push back the Dec. 8 deadline wouldn’t buy lawmakers much time.

In mid-January, budgetary caps will kick in and cause across-the-board cuts to government spending. The Treasury Department estimated there would also be a January deadline for raising the debt ceiling.

But the push for tax reform is expected to be all-consuming, pushing the funding issues aside.

House Republicans delayed the release of the bill by one day this week as they worked out internal differences. They hope to start marking up the bill in committee next week and pass it the following week on the House floor, despite internal opposition to provisions dealing with state and local taxes.

Francisco Antonio de Lorenzana y Butrón (22 September 1722 – 17 April 1804) was a Catholic Cardinal, who had also earlier served as Archbishop of Mexico.

Biography  
After the completion of his studies at the Jesuit College of his native city, he entered the ecclesiastical state and was appointed, at an early date, to a canonry in Toledo. In 1765 he was named Bishop of Plasencia (not Palencia, as sometimes erroneously stated). The following year he was called upon to assume the difficult charge of the large Archdiocese of Mexico.  He established an asylum for foundlings there at his own expense. He collected and published the acts of the first three provincial councils of Mexico held respectively in 1555, 1565, and 1585: Concilios provinciales, I, II, III, de Mexico (Mexico, 1769–70).

In 1771 he held the Fourth Mexican Provincial council synod, which was strongly regalist. (However its decrees, which he forwarded to Madrid for confirmation, were buried in the royal archives). He also brought together valuable historical documents relating to the secular and religious history of Mexico and published them in a richly illustrated work under the title, Historia de Nueva Espana (Mexico, 1770). According to one scholar, Lorenzana ""became an outspoken critic of the crown's ecclesiastical policy and warned Charles III that his measures were Protestant heresies."" 

In 1772 he was recalled to Spain and placed at the head of the Archdiocese of Toledo. He built a library for this city and collected the works of the principal writers of the Church of Toledo. These writings appeared in an edition, SS. Patrum Toletanorum opera (Madrid, 1782–93). He likewise published a new edition of the Gothic or Mozarabic Breviary, Breviarium Gothicum (Madrid, 1775), and Mozarabic Missal, Missale Gothicum (Rome, 1804). In the introductions to these publications he discussed the Mozarabic liturgy. Editions of Spanish conciliar decrees, the Roman Catechism, and the Canons of the Council of Trent also engaged his attention, and the works of Isidore of Seville were published at his expense by the Spanish Jesuit, Faustino Arévalo: S. Isidori Hispalensis Opera Omnia (Rome, 1797–1803).

Along with these scientific pursuits he actively carried on social work, founding hospitals and as",546,11,ylums. He converted a castle to a workhouse

The August 31 schedules will see a return to fall service across the system as well as several other changes. At long last (I have been distracted with other events, and there was a lot to do this month) here is the consolidated list of service changes. The list combines all types of change because there are overlapping seasonal, construction and service improvement effects.

The table linked here has been updated to correct errors missed in its creation. Thanks to Timor Urakov for catching these.

Something I have not included here, but will add in a future update, is a list of all of the Standby Buses (and a few streetcars) that are spotted around the city for various reasons. They don’t show up in the route-by-route info, but there is a substantial chunk of the fleet used to provide this service. Due to a bus shortage, the number of standby vehicles scheduled for fall 2014 is lower than originally planned.

510 Spadina

Streetcars will return to Spadina between Bloor and Queens Quay with all service running through to the south end of the line. The route will be scheduled based on CLRV capacity, and new Flexities will take over runs one by one as cars become available. Current plans are for through service to Union and a resumption of streetcar service on 509 Harbourfront in October.

At the end of the AM Peak, 508 Lake Shore trippers operate a westbound trip as 506 Carlton to provide extra capacity to the UofT St. George campus. These trips previously operated back to Roncesvalles Carhouse, but they will be changed so that the cars switch over to 510 Spadina which has more cars during the midday than the AM peak.

Previously, this interlining was done using 503 Kingston Road cars from Russell, but with the move of 510 Spadina to Roncesvalles, trippers from that division will be used.

504 King Running Time Changes

In an attempt to reduce the need to short turn much of the service to keep operators on time, the TTC is changing the round trip times during all periods of service on this route.

In the table above, the “before” times are shown under “Aug” and are taken from the schedules in effect until Aug. 30. The “after” times are shown under “Sept” and are taken from the schedules effective Aug. 31.

The time is given as running time plus recovery time. For example, the AM peak running time of “120+8” means that cars will have 120 minutes of driving time to make a round trip plus 8 minutes of terminal recovery time. Some of the changes increase the total time by 20%, a very substantial increase.

Whether this will translate into a noticeable reduction in short turns remains to be seen. One potential problem will be the accumulation of “early” cars at terminals where it is already possible to find lineups of cars. From my own knowledge of the line, some of these changes appear to be excessive and will probably have to be rolled back.

501 Queen & 508 Lake Shore

From September through December, reconstruction of the Gardiner Expressway at Humber Loop will close off the underpass between the loop and Lake Shore Blvd. The outer end of the Queen route will once again switch to a shuttle bus connecting with the streetcar.

Subway Changes

Yonge subway operations will be changed to base more trains at Davisville Yard. This will give more time for maintenance work as the last service trains will be clear of the line sooner than on current schedules. An early morning non-revenue train that carries Station Collectors to work will be replaced with a shuttle",789,11," bus.

Cir. 2008). There was ample evidence to prove that only two detectives were

present for the interrogation in Holley’s home, Holley was not restrained, and he

was not isolated from the members of his family, who were in the room when he

was questioned. In the totality of the circumstances, Holley was not questioned in

the “police-dominated atmosphere” that makes an interrogation in a person’s home

custodial and, therefore, requires Miranda warnings. See Craighead, 539 F.3d at

      Because Holley was not in custody for the purpose of Miranda when he

made statements to the detectives on January 6, 2010, the questioning of him on

General provisions

Without prejudice to discretion afforded by
Article 8 of the Directive on Assignment of Defence Counsel
(""Directive""), the Registry uses the following policy
to determine the extent to which an applicant for legal aid
is able to remunerate counsel. When an applicant for legal aid
submits a declaration of means pursuant to Article 7(B) of the
Directive, the Registry assesses the income and assets of the
applicant, his spouse and the persons with whom he habitually
resides. In doing so the Registry may rely on the applicant’s
declaration of means or undertake an inquiry into the applicant’s
means pursuant to Article 10 of the Directive. From the established
pool of income and assets, the Registry calculates the applicant’s
disposable means, according to Sections 5-8 of this policy.
From the disposable means, the Registry deducts the estimated
living expenses of the applicant’s family and dependents during
the estimated period in which the applicant will require representation
before the International Tribunal. The amount remaining is the
contribution to be made by the applicant to his defence.

Karl Kraus's epic war play The Last Days of Mankind is, believes
Niall Ferguson
, the greatest drama written this century. So why has it had to wait 77 years for its English premiere?

12:00AM GMT 18 Dec 1999

IT is not entirely surprising that England has had to wait until the last days of the 20th century to enjoy Karl Kraus's play The Last Days of Mankind. Written between 1915 and 1922, it did not receive its German premiere until 1964, 50 years after the outbreak of the war that inspired it, and nearly 30 years after the author's death. Kraus himself said it was designed for a theatre on Mars, and not only on account of its immense length (more than 200 scenes) and technical difficulties. Name one other play that requires 1,200 horses to trot out of the sea in the wake of a singing flame-thrower.

Yet (provided Kraus's stage directions are not taken literally), The Last Days is no harder to stage than Wagner's Ring cycle, another immense German-language masterpiece with an apocalyptic climax. It is also a great deal funnier. And to my mind this extraordinary play is a work of genius every bit as imposing as Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk. It is certainly the greatest dramatic satire of the 20th century. I would go so far as to call it the greatest drama.

This weekend's BBC radio production by the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre dates back to the Edinburgh Festival of 1983. That incarnation remains the most electrifying theatrical experience I have ever had. Now, more than 16 years on, those unlucky enough to have missed it on stage can hear Robert David MacDonald's inspired translation with a similar if not stronger cast, once again under Giles Havergal's masterly direction.

Why devote four hours (condensed from 15) to the work of a Viennese writer hardly anyone in this country has heard of? To begin with, because this is one of the great works of anti-war literature, on a par with All Quiet on the Western Front. What makes it quite different from Remarque's novel is that Kraus was a civilian. Though there are numerous front-line scenes in the play, this is the war as seen from the home front - in the coffee houses of Habsburg Vienna. And, unexpectedly, this proves to be as good a vantage point as the trenches. After all, without the civilians, this first total war could not have been sustained.

Kraus's main aim is to expose the warmongers: not only the posturing generals and the profiteering industrialists but also - above all - the purveyors of propaganda: the press.

For Kraus, the First World War was the first media war, and its grotesque ironies at once fascinate and appal him. Thus, newsreel of the sinking of the Lusitania is preceded in cinemas by the announcement: ""Smoking permitted at this point in the programme."" Today, ""you could not make it up"" has become a tired catch-phrase. Kraus was the first satirist to realise that such absurdities did not need to be invented. The most surreal scenes turn out to be straight quotations.

In a cast of hundreds, the key villain of The Last Days of Mankind is Alice Schalek, the war correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse. To Schalek, battles are no different from the plays she reviewed in peacetime: ""performances"" at the Front are ""first-class"" and officers are interviewed as if they were stars of the stage. Schalek herself takes a turn with a gun and finds it especially ""interesting"" when (as she has been warned) the enemy returns fire. So damning is Kraus's portrayal that, when the play was first published, Schalek sued; indeed, her brother challenged him to a duel.

Throughout the play, Kraus shows how journalistic language glosses over the realities of war and thereby helps perpetuate it. But he goes further. The war, he suggests, is actually a consequence of the power of the press.

""Would the war have been possible at all without the press?"" he asks. ""We were crippled by the newspaper printing presses before the cannons claimed their first victims... The war guilt of the press is not that it set the machinery of death in motion, but that it hollowed out our hearts so that we could no longer imagine",939,11," what it was going to be like.""

Aber man kann den Leuten nicht hinter die Stirn schauen.“ Momentan ist Worch nach eigenen Angaben nicht informiert, welche Mitglieder seiner Partei verhaftet worden sind. Der Landesverband Bayern sei erst im Mai dieses Jahres gegründet worden und habe zwischen 60 und 70 Mitgliedern.

Worch distanzierte sich nicht von den Tatverdächtigen. Und auf die Haftbefehle will er ausdrücklich nicht mit der Einleitung eines Parteiausschlussverfahrens gegen die Betreffenden reagieren. Selbst wenn diese als Täter rechtskräftig verurteilt würden, wolle er, Worch, das Urteil dahingehend prüfen, ob die gefundenen Waffen nicht auch der „sinnvollen Selbstverteidigung“ hätten dienen können. Er selbst sei im Besitz mehrerer Schwerter und Dolche aus der Zeit des Mittelalters und habe auch schon einmal eine Schusswaffe besessen. Bei der Bestellung von mehreren Kilogramm Feuerwerkssprengkörpern aus Polen will Worch davon ausgehen, dass diese auch für Silvester hätten genutzt werden können.

Momochi: So Smug's teammate is a Hakan/Guile player. And there's this Yang player that I heard about from my friend in America. I showed him my pool bracket and asked him if there's anyone good, and he told me to take note on this Yang player. I tried to look him up on youtube to do some research on him, but there were just no results. (laughs) I found some videos after swapping one letter, but I was skeptical if it's the same guy. So I asked my friend again to double check if it's the same guy he has in his mind, but he said that guy is definitely a Yang player. I took his word for it and decided to prepare for Yang, Guile, and Hakan matchups. But... there just wasn't any Yang in my pool. So in the end I just got matched with that Hakan/Guile player. You know, Hakan is kinda scary... Since I mainly use Ken, I was hoping he would go for Guile. But at the back of my mind, I already made a decision to pick Juri if he showed any sign that he would pick Hakan. So right when I went to the station, I had Ken on my side of the character select screen already, making my intention to pick him from start evident. Then thankfully he picked Guile, so it worked out for me. That match went without a hitch, and I made it out of my pool.

Mago: That's an interesting thing about EVO. The rules about character select are not clear cut. No players are really required to declare and register their main characters.

Bonchan: For players who use multiple characters, character select in and of itself is a reading/mind game.

Mago: But you can ask the pool manager to be a judge if there are any issues.

Momochi: For me, there wasn't an issue. [Character select] went pretty smoothly. Picking known main character was like an unspoken rule.

Mago: I see. Who was at 12pm?

Fuudo: My pool wasn't too difficult. I got an intel at first that Lapchi is there. I was determined to win against him, but I don't think he was in my pool. He was [at EVO], though, right?

Mago: Yeah, I heard he was in the same pool as this guy called Nerotan, who is other fellow Japanese player. I heard he went up against Lapchi in their pool's final, and they had a good game. It was a Blanka mirror match, and Lapchi lost. But anyway.

Fuudo: Nothing really happened. I think I made it out not losing a round.

Mago: And next is 2pm? I was in that. My pool was just uneventful. Nothing happened.

Bonchan: You mean you didn't make anything happen? You were just that good?

Mago: Yeah, it was just a really easy pool. It might come off rude to those who were in that pool, but they were just not in the same league as me. I don't think I lost a round. I breezed through it and made it out, and that means getting top... 256? Ok, now Bonchan.

Bonchan: I saw this good Makoto and good Guile playing in my pool. Either way, it's not a matchup I like, so I already felt discouraged there. Makoto player was really good, but Guile player took the game. I got matched with him in Semifinal, but for some reason he picked Ryu instead. I went ""You're kidding me. Are you trying to psych me out?"". He even went so far as to picking Ultra 1. I thought he was throwing this match. I just swept him easily. I thought ""Picking Metsu Hadoken? This is a last call to go back!"".

Mago: Oh yeah, that's right. Since you play Sagat, you have a harder time against Guile than Ryu.

Bonchan: Yeah, and what I don't get is that he seemed to play Guile as his main. He was playing comfortably with Guile from what I've seen. I",961,11, still don't understand why he picked Ryu and stuck with

The history of Isan (, ) has been determined by its geography, situated as it is on the Korat Plateau between Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.

The national government claimed that the name ""Isan"" was derived from Sanskrit Īśāna, a name of Shiva they claimed referred to his rule of the northeast (Sanskrit īśānya). This interpretation was intended to reinforce Isan's identity as the northeast of Thailand, rather than as part of the Lao kingdom because of the fear",117,11," of the Lao people seceding.

2. Description of Related Art
There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possess the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single variety an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, better agronomic quality, resistance to herbicides, and improvements in compositional traits.

============

Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammation of the optic nerve and has various causes such as demyelinating, infective, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, toxic, metabolic, and hereditary neuropathy.

Most commonly it is a demyelinating inflammation of the optic nerve and typically, initially occurs in young adults. It may occur in isolation or association with multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica.[@ref1]-[@ref4]

In cases associated with MS, ON is commonly the first manifestation of the chronic disease.[@ref3] It has been observed in long-term follow-up studies that up to 75% of female and 35% of male patients initially presenting with ON may develop MS.[@ref4]-[@ref7]

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at the initial presentation can demonstrate silent demyelinating lesions. Patients with isolated ON (without MRI brain lesions) have a 16%, 22% risk of progression to MS at 5, 10 years follow-up, respectively. This risk increases to 56% in patients with MRI brain lesions at 10 years follow-up.[@ref8]-[@ref12]

The demyelinating ON affects females more than males with 3:1 ratio.[@ref13] Most of the patients are between 20 and 45 years of age.[@ref8]-[@ref10] It is unilateral in 70% of cases and is rare in children. Loss of vision, periocular pain and dyschromatopsia are considered to be the triad of inflammatory ON. For most patients with ON, visual function improves gradually over several weeks, in some cases can begin to improve after 1 week, even without any treatment. However, permanent residual deficits in color vision and contrast and brightness sensitivity can occur.

We aimed to analyze the records of ON patients, presented to King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Buraidah, KSA (KFSH), in regard to their presentation, natural history, treatment outcome and risk and association of MS. Moreover, whether ON in Saudi patients behaves differently from the Western and Asian ON patients?

Methods {#sec1-2}
=======

After approval from the Ethical committee, in this retrospective study, we retrieved data from the medical records of patients who attended the ophthalmology and neurology services in KFSH Buraidah, from 2006 to 2012.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria {#sec2-1}
--------------------------------

Patients older than 12 years presented with acute onset visual symptoms such as loss of visual acuity (VA) with or without eye pain and those with afferent pupillary defects. Patients below this age present to the children's hospital.

We excluded patients who showed any evidence of hereditary, vascular, toxic, metabolic, infiltrative, or compressive optic neuropathy.

The demographic variables and ON related variables including presenting symptoms, unilateral or bilateral involvement, relevant neurological symptoms, VA, color vision, pupil and fundoscopic findings, neuroimaging results, and any treatment offered and outcome were retrieved from the files of these patients and recorded on a structured pro forma.

Statistical analysis {#sec2-2}
--------------------

Statistical software ""Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)-20.0"" was used for data analysis. Descriptive analyses were done. Ratios for gender distribution and mean standard deviation (SD) were computed for age distribution.

Frequencies and percentages were computed to present the categorical variables such as age of onset of ON, unilateral or bilateral involvement, VA, visual fields, fundoscopic, and neuroimaging findings.

order of the bankruptcy court. In re Combustion Eng’g, Inc., 391 F.3d 190, 214 (3d

Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). The persons-aggrieved test “now exists as a

rights or interests are directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by an order or

decree of the bankruptcy court.’” Id. (further quotation marks omitted) (quoting In

re Dykes, 10 F.3d 184, 187 (3d Cir. 1993)). To be a person aggrieved, a party must

challenge an order that “diminishes their property, increases their burdens, or

impairs their rights.” Id. (quoting In re PWS Holding Corp., 228 F.3d 224, 249 (3d

Cir. 2000)).

      This standard is “more restrictive than Article III standing.” Id. at 215.

Appellate bankruptcy standing, unlike Article III standing, must be based strictly

on financial injury. Id. Furthermore, this Court has denied standing to parties

“who, even though they may be exposed to some potential harm incident to the

Generally, studies comparing the expression of claudins in benign or borderline ovarian tumors *versus* ovarian carcinoma have not been entirely conclusive \[[@b1-ijms-14-10412],[@b14-ijms-14-10412],[@b16-ijms-14-10412],[@b55-ijms-14-10412],[@b56-ijms-14-10412]\]. However, most of the prevailing literature provides evidence that claudin-3 and -4 are highly differentially expressed in ovarian cancer and also correlate with chemo-resistance and poorer survival albeit some differing results have been reported depending on cell lines studied.

Claudin-1, -3, -4, -5 and -7 are the claudins most commonly overexpressed in ovarian tumors ([Table 1](#t1-ijms-14-10412){ref-type=""table""}). Overall, in reviewing several studies, it is evident that claudin expression is altered in a variety of tumors with the most commonly identified claudins to have an altered expression being claudin-1, -3, -4, -5, -7, -10 and -16 \[[@b10-ijms-14-10412]\]. This phenomenon is likely due to the role of claudins in tumor survival and invasion, as it is not unusual for some carcinomatous tissue to lose their TJ proteins as they grow and develop \[[@b10-ijms-14-10412],[@b57-ijms-14-10412]--[@b59-ijms-14-10412]\], for example, claudin-1 and -7 are typically downregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas \[[@b5-ijms-14-10412],[@b60-ijms-14-10412]\].

TJ-tight junction, HCV- hepatitis C virus, CPE- Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, RPE- retinal pigment epithelium, EPCAM- epithelial cell adhesion molecule.

Claudin function is regulated at many sites including at the level of the tight junction as a result of crosstalk between tight junction components \[[@b64-ijms-14-10412]\]. In addition several claudins are known to be phosphorylated by kinases which may affect both claudin position and function. Another potential mechanism of regulation of claudin expression is endocytic recycling of claudin proteins \[[@b65-ijms-14-10412]\]. At the transcriptional level, there is evidence that transcription factors such as GATA-4 and Snail are able to bind to the promoter regions of several claudin genes and affect their expression \[[@b66-ijms-14-10412],[@b67-ijms-14-10412]\]. The claudins may also be downregulated not only at the point of transcription but also post-transcriptionally via a variety of cytokines and growth factors \[[@b64-ijms-14-10412],[@b68-ijms-14-10412]\].

Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) signaling has been demonstrated to modulate the expression of the claudins in various cell types \[[@b48-ijms-14-10412],[@b69-ijms-14-10412],[@b70-ijms-14-10412]\]. Recently this mechanism of the TJ protein regulation in ovarian cancers was explored by treating both ovarian mucinous and serous cystadenocarcinoma cell lines with EGF \[[@b71-ijms-14-10412]\]. EGF was found to downregulate claudin-3 in mucinous ovarian carcinoma cell lines and claudin-4 in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma by inducing the degradation of these proteins with also changes in the structure and function of TJ via the MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The pretreatment with EGFR inhibitors, MEK/ERK inhibitors and PI3K/AKT inhibitors in the ovarian mucinous cystadenocarcinoma cell lines prevented the decrease of claudin-3 by EGF. On the other hand, for serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines, pretreatment with inhibitors of EGFR, MEK/ERK but not PI3K/AKT prevented the decrease in claudin-4 by EGF. This suggests alternative mechanisms for claudin regulation by",996,11, EGF among the different ovarian carcinoma subtypes *

This invention relates generally to an improved compact gas fired water heater for installation in recreational vehicles. Specifically this invention relates to a gas fired water heater of compact size with an improved combustion chamber that offers manufacturing, dimensional, cost and performance advantages over water heaters of this type currently available for such installations.
2. Description of the Related Art
While combustion chambers of various designs and configurations have been invented and used for furnace and other space heating applications, the methods employed over the years for combustion chambers for water heaters for the recreational vehicle market has been limited to direct vent type designs to meet rigid space limitations, test pressure requirements mandated by various regulatory codes, and design methods that will offer the most economical products to the RV manufacturer and the consumer. Consequently water heaters for recreational vehicles continue to be made with direct vent type combustion chambers employing either bent tubes that permit the inlet and outlet ends of the tube to both be positioned on the front of the water heater, or a larger diameter straight horizontal tube, closed at the rear, wherein gases enter the lower front half and exit the upper front half of the horizontally positioned tube.
With the bent tube type combustion chambers utilized in many RV water heater tanks today, hot gases are injected by a burner into an entrance of a tube in the lower portion of the water heater and exit the other end of the same tube in the upper portion of the water heater. Both ends, the entrance and exit, are positioned in front of the water heater, consequently the fronts of such water heaters must be large enough to accommodate the ""U"" shaped bend in the tube between the entrance and the exit. Due to the large radius required to made the ""U"" shaped bend without distorting the tube, the dimensions of such water heaters must be either wider or higher than a water heater employing the single straight tube type construction.
While water heaters utilizing a single horizontal tube type heat exchanger may have smaller width or height dimensions in front of the water heaters than water heaters made with bent tube type combustion chambers, they have other disadvantages. In this method of design, the products of combustion pass through the lower portion of the horizontal tube below an internal median divider that extends approximately four fifths of the way from the front to the back of the tube. The gases make a turn in the rear of the tube as they make contact with the rear closure plate, whereby they then move upward and exit through the top portion to the tube above the entrance. This construction while permitting compactness, has severe limitations in performance due to the slowing down of the movement of the hot gases resulting from the abrupt turn in back of the tube as well as the large internal diameter of the tube, generally 41/2"" in the water heaters being offered today. A smaller tube diameter used in the same manner, while speeding up the flow of gases by having less internal area, would at the same time be ineffective since the total amount of heating surface making contact with the water would also be reduced accordingly, and in general, even the water heaters with the 41/2"" diameter tubes have heating surface limitations below that of water heaters using bent tubes with separate inlets and outlets. In addition the total travel distance of the hot gases permitted with the straight horizontal tube type construction is also considerably less than the distance of travel within a combustion chamber that utilizes a separate inlet and outlet, and this further restricts the efficiency of such water heaters.
In a more recent invention, a combustion chamber is employed for compact water heaters that does not utilize a tube of any kind. This combustion chamber, similar to those used in furnaces in earlier inventions, utilizes two shell shaped halves welded together to form an internal flow pattern within a tank. While meeting the pressure requirements mandated for water heaters, this type of construction has several disadvantages inhibiting its use. Due to the large perimeters of the two halves utilized in its construction, a considerable amount of increased welding is required to weld the two halves together. In a typical water tank for a water heater of this type, the total amount of welding required for the tank is increased by approximately 20 to 25 percent. In the case of a glass",853,11," lined tank, the increase in the area of the weld"

795,0,23949,0,"As Rockies fans braced for Todd Helton's potential exit this week, there was a bit of good news. ESPN.com ranked Colorado's farm system the second best in baseball. The reality, according to owner Charlie Monfort, is that the Rockies have no choice but to continue to develop young talent because they are not going to be able to keep it.

Failing to move a large chunk of Helton's contract to Boston - as unpopular as it may have been - leaves the Rockies in a difficult position as they try to retain young talent such as pitcher Aaron Cook, closer Brian Fuentes and, most notably, all-star outfielder Matt Holliday beyond this year.

Unless, that is, ownership greatly expands payroll, which it has shown no desire to do.

""It makes it tough. But who knows what's going to happen?"" Monfort said. ""People are already saying that we are not staying with homegrown guys (because of the Jason Jennings trade). But when we say we are going to stick with them, that doesn't mean through thick and thin for 12 to 14 years.

""That means you keep them while you can go through arbitration and hope that you have somebody coming behind them to take their place because, quite frankly, in this market we can't afford that. If people want to say that we are a minor-league team for the Yankees and somebody is going to pick Matt off for $14 (million) a year (as a free agent), so be it.""

UPDATE – Ignore the Broadcom driver stuff. It seemed to be ok all afternoon, but I have rebooted the ESXi host and it’s gone completely unstable again, with pretty much continuous iSCSI disconnects. Clearly this TOE/iSCSI offload support is absolutely terrible. I’m going to have to use the software initiator. What is the point of Dell marketing this?

UPDATE 2 – Dell decided to get to the bottom of this and, following an extended troubleshooting session in which I reverted one of the hypervisors, they were able to replicate the fault in their lab. It’s now being escalated with VMware and Broadcom. More news as I get it…

I’m doing this upgrade at the moment from vSphere 4.1U1 so I wanted to make notes, particularly on the hypervisor rebuild part, so I don’t have to keep looking stuff up when I do each one. Since 4.1 I have used the hardware iSCSI offload features of the Broadcom bnx2 chips in the servers, using them as HBAs in their own right. As per the Dell MEM driver 1.1 release notes they still don’t support using jumbo frames with this configuration. However, I had big problems with getting this working at all with 5.0. According to Dell support I’m in a minority of customers that use TOE so their inclination was to suggest I fall back to software iSCSI. I purposely delayed adopting vSphere 5.0 until it had been out for a few months to hopefully avoid being among the first to hit major issues, but I still ran into this. The problem manifests itself as regular errors (every few seconds) in the array logs like this:

iSCSI login to target ‘192.168.100.12:3260, iqn.2001-05.com.equallogic:0-8a0906-c541d5105-94c0000000a4adc3-vsphere’ from initiator ‘192.168.100.25:2076, iqn.1998-01.com.vmware:server.domain.com:1454019294:34’ failed for the following reason: Initiator disconnected from target during login.

These errors are generated by all HBAs that are configured for storage. Furthermore only one path is established, and the volume will occasionally go offline altogether. The ESXi host’s /var/log/vmkernel.log shows bnx2 disconnection events like this:

Dell support’s first suggestion",575,11, is to edit the iSCSI login timeout value from

If the Lorentz singlet would be split into two lines, their centroids would have been 0.06 mm/s apart, which is the measure of quadrupole splitting ($\Delta$). The measured isomer shift is consistent with Fe$^{2+}$, in agreement with X-ray absorbtion and photoemission spectroscopy studies.[@KwonK] There is very mild discrepancy of Mössbauer theoretical curve when compared to observed values near 0.2 mm/s, most likely due to texture effects and small deviations of incident $\gamma$ rays from the c-axis of the crystal. The point defect corrections to Mössbauer fitting curve are negligible. Fig. 2(b) presents the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) magnetic susceptibility taken at 10 Oe applied perpendicular to the $c$ axis for FeS and FeS$_{0.94}$Se$_{0.06}$ single crystals. Superconducting transition temperature Tc = 4.4 K (onset of diamagnetic signal) is observed in FeS, consistent with previous report.[@LaiXF] There is almost no change of $T_c$ in FeS$_{0.94}$Se$_{0.06}$. Both samples exhibit bulk superconductivity with somewhat enhanced diamagnetic shielding with Se substitution.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the magnetization hysteresis loops (MHL) for FeS and FeS$_{0.94}$Se$_{0.06}$, respectively. Both MHLs show symmetric field dependence and absence of paramagnetic background, suggestive of dominant bulk pinning.[@LinH] No fishtail effect is observed in both samples. The critical current density $J_c$ can be calculated from MHL using the Bean model.[@Bean] When the field is applied along $c$ axis, the in-plane critical current density $J_c(\mu_0H)$ is given by[@Bean; @Gyorgy] $${J}_{c} = \frac{20\Delta M(\mu_0H)}{a(1-a/3b)}$$ where $\Delta M(\mu_0H)$ is the width of magnetization loop at specific applied field value and is measured in emu/cm$^{3}$. The $a$ and $b$ are the width and length of the sample ($a$$\leq$$b$) and measured in cm. The $J_c$ used in the formula is the unrelaxed critical current density. Practically measured critical current density, however, is the $J_s$ (relaxed value). Because magnetization relaxation is not very strong in iron-based superconductors, the $J_s$$\approx$$J_c$.[@ShenB] The paramagnetic (linear) $M(\mu_{0}H)$ background has no effect on the calculation of $\Delta$M($\mu_{0}$H) and consequently crucial currents due to its subtraction. The inclusion of ferromagnetic impurities[@Holenstein] is unlikely due to highly symmetric M(H) loops (Fig. 3). Therefore we attribute somewhat reduced volume fraction in pure tetragonal FeS to the presence of the unreacted paramagnetic hydrothermal solvent on the surface of our crystal, similar to what has been observed before.[@Lai",857,11,"XF]

799,0,29214,1025,"�. And the American leader reiterated that Russia will face “additional costs” for its “annexation” of Crimea. Putin riposted that the process was legal.

European ministers met in Brussels on Monday to draw up punitive sanctions on senior Russian officials. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton referred snidely to the “so-called referendum” and dismissed it as “illegal under international law”. That’s rich coming from “Lady Ashton” who has never faced an election in her life and who owes her entire political career to secret decisions taken by privilege and patronage.

Ashton’s claim of illegality was echoed by European Council president Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso.

Tellingly, despite their pomposity and pejorative assertions, none of the Western leaders, or the dutiful mainstream news media, offer a legal argument to support their claim that the people of Crimea have acted unlawfully or unconstitutionally. The official Western position seems to rely solely on force of bombastic rhetoric and nothing else.

Perhaps, these political hacks in high office secretly know that if they were to engage in real discussions based on objective legal principles and standards, their arguments would be swiftly decimated, given their own support for the neo-Nazi putschists who ransacked their way into government in Kiev with acts of murder and massive intimidation. If the Western sponsors of the fascist coup are not careful, their empty talk about constitutionality and due process could rebound to expose their own criminal involvement in regime change.

For now the people of Crimea have dealt a blow to Western machinations in Ukraine, with a bold “check”.

However, the game is not over yet. The reactionary regime in Kiev is calling up a “national guard” of 60,000 members that will incorporate the Right Sector paramilitaries. The neo-Nazi security ministers, Andriy Parubiy and Dmitry Yarosh, are calling for military attacks on Crimea and the pro-Russian population in the East of Ukraine. Yarosh has even warned that his Pravy Sektor shock troops will blow up Russian gas pipelines that run through Ukraine to Europe. And there are plenty of American political hotheads who want to arm the Kiev fascists. Senator John McCain, along with a delegation of other belligerent US congressmen visiting Kiev this week, spoke openly about arming the junta. “Russia is a giant gas station masquerading as a country”, said McCain, relishing an opportunity to attack Moscow.

As the news of the Crimea referendum was being celebrated in its capital, Simferopol, and other cities, the Kiev-appointed foreign minister Andriy Deshchytsya was in Brussels meeting NATO chiefs to discuss “military cooperation”. Deshchytsya announced provocatively: “Ukraine reserves the right to use all necessary measures to stop military invasion by Russia.”

Washington and its European allies, together with their proxy regime in Kiev, are evidently so full of their own self-righteous propaganda that the possibility of further escalation of conflict with Russia is very possible, even though there are absolutely no justifiable grounds for such aggression.

Increased conflict will lead to further polarization of the pro-Russian populations in East Ukraine, who are likely step up their calls for similar secession from Kiev, as in Crimea. That conjures up a very real danger of civil war breaking out in Ukraine that will surely spell an end to Western regime change plans. A worst-case scenario would be for such a conflict to explode into an all-out war between the US, its NATO allies and Russia, with the Kiev shock troops working on the ground, reminiscent of Libya and Syria.

But the crucial reality check restraining such a catastrophic outcome is Europe’s mortal dependence on Russian oil and gas. Over one-third of all the European Union’s oil and gas is supplied from Russia. In Germany, the EU economic powerhouse, that dependency on Russian fuel reaches up to 40 per cent.

European leaders are thus playing a reckless and deluded game by antagonizing Russia over its legitimate national interests in Ukraine. Washington may be making the loudest noises for sanctions and “costs” being imposed on Russia. But when the going gets tough, it",905,11," will be Europe that pays the price, from the collapse"

Is there a way to prevent Geb from returning null from void methods?

In a Spock Specification any line in expect: or then: block is evaluated and asserted as boolean, unless it has signature with return type void.
I've noticed that there is something odd going on for methods declared as void on any class inheriting from Navigator (for example Page or Module classes).
Let say we have such example:
class NavigationSpec extends GebSpec {

    def 'Collections page has a right header'() {

        when:
            to CollectionsPage

        then:
            hasHeaderText('Collections')
    }
}

The hasHeaderText() method is defined within CollectionsPage class as follows:
class CollectionsPage extends Page {

    static url ='movies/collections'

    void hasHeaderText(String expectedText) {
        assert true
    }
}

On purpose I'm just asserting true over there so it should never fail. Even though it fails with an error:
Condition not satisfied:

hasHeaderText('Collections')
|
null

How and why a void method call result is evaluated as null?
I know how to 'fix it'. It's enough to declare the method return type as boolean and return true. This is ugly though as following all the asserts otherwise unnecessary return true has to be added like:
boolean hasHeaderText(String expectedText) {
  ",362,11,"  assert header.text() == expectedText

Some people luckily walk away from a car accident relatively unscathed, with perhaps just a bruise or minor sprain to show for it.

Transdermal delivery does provide the ability to deliver drugs directly to general circulation. Effective transdermal delivery affords a controlled, constant, zero-order release of active compound. Transdermal delivery is greatly advantageous in that it can be used in pediatric age groups, where IV or IM dosing is very difficult.
Another advantage of transdermal delivery is that the delivery of the active can be rapidly terminated by removing the patch. Other routes of delivery do not possess this most desirable advantage.
Recognizing that the outer layer of the skin, the epidermis, protects the area under the skin from penetration of foreign chemicals, various enhancing agents have been used to deliver drugs transdermally. Substances that help promote drug diffusion through the stratum corneum and epidermis are referred to as skin-penetration enhancers, accelerants, adjuvants and absorption promoters. B.

809,0,27703,0,"Brar raid accused freed

London, Oct. 6: All eight people arrested yesterday in connection with the attempted murder of retired Lt Gen. Kuldip Singh Brar have been released on bail.

The seven men and one woman have been asked to return in November pending further inquiries. It seems unlikely any of them were among the four men who actually tried to kill the general who led Operation Bluestar in 1984. But three other men picked up on October 4 remain in custody, Scotland Yard said today.

Scotland Yard is certainly spreading its net wide but until and unless there is a charge, it is impossible to say whether police are any closer to prosecuting the would-be assailants of Brar who was stabbed in the neck.

Police are themselves urging caution. Nowhere has Scotland Yard said Sikhs are involved in the attack on Brar late on the night of September 30 in Marble Arch in central London. But the counter argument is: “Who else would want to kill him?”

The four have been “described as being of Asian appearance, and were wearing dark clothing and long black jackets. They all had long beards. One of the men is described as younger and slimmer than the other three.”

Even Brar has not been mentioned by name, only as an “Indian national”, aged 78, who was visiting London with his wife. In one statement, Scotland Yard said: “The attack may have caused concern among our Indian and Sikh communities. While we are aware that there has been a great deal of speculation about possible motivation for this attack, it would not be helpful to our investigation to comment further at this stage.”

Scotland Yard is using letters of the alphabet to denote the characters who have been arrested. At the rate officers from the “Counter Terrorism Command” are going, police may soon pass Z. This is the catalogue as it stands of arrests, mainly of men for conspiracy to murder, with the geographical spread:

A — aged 33, at residential address in Wolverhampton at 5pm on October 4. Remains in custody.

B — woman, aged 40, at same address as above. Released on bail.

C — aged 34, at 5.30pm on October 4 after a car was stopped on Heath Lane in West Bromwich. In custody.

D — aged 25, at 7pm in same circumstances as C. In custody.

E — aged 42, at 0030 on October 5 at a residential address in Hillingdon, west London, on suspicion of assisting an offender. Released on bail.

F — woman, aged 38, at same address as E. Released on bail.

G — aged 34, 1am on October 5 on Queensdale Road, west London. Released on bail.

H — aged 30. Same address at G. Released on bail.

I — aged 31. Same address as G and H. Released on bail.

J — aged 33. At 5am on October 5 at residential address in Holland Park, west London. Released on bail.

K — aged 31. Same address as J. Released on bail.

L — 20 years. Same address as J and K. On suspicion of assisting an offender. Released on bail.

M — aged 45. Same address as J, K and L on suspicion of immigration matters unconnected with investigation into the attempted murder. Released on bail.

N — aged 29 years. Same as M. Released on bail.

– aged 28 years. Same as M and N. Released on bail.

Police said that M, N and were referred to the UK Border Agency which looks after immigration violations, while all the others were interviewed by Scotland Yard officers at police stations in central and west London.

Police are appealing for more witnesses. “In particular they want to speak to those people who assisted the wife and the victim at the scene following the attack.”

Police are seeking answers to the questions: Who provided the tip-off on the whereabouts of Brar?

How did the assailants know he was in London? Brar has said he told the army command of his UK trip but the High Commission in London knew nothing about it — so who was the source of the leak? Was there a mole in India? Are any or all the four men who attacked Brar settled in the UK or did any come from abroad? Did any enter the UK illegally? Who assisted them? Were there safe houses? Was the plot hatched in the",952,11, UK or abroad? Why did the men carry just a

Based on the insight that some proteins can escape the renal filtering process, the authors searched for *Loa* proteins in urine obtained from a loiasis patient. Proteins of \>3 kDa were precipitated with acetone and subjected to tryptic digestion. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (LC) and submitted for tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. A number of candidate *Loa* proteins were identified by this approach, all of which were found in MF. Filtering through bioinformatics screens eliminated proteins with significant homology to human proteins or proteins from other filariae and allowed the authors to prioritize a single *Loa* MF protein, termed LOAG_16927, which is unique to *L. loa* and has no predicted function.

The authors then developed a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify the levels of this antigen in plasma based on a modification of the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) format ([@B14]); using defined amounts of recombinant LOAG_16927 for competition, the authors developed a competitive LIPS assay that provided a reasonable correlation between antigen abundance and MF density in samples obtained from loiasis patients. This is the first potentially quantitative, MF-specific, antigen-based diagnostic test described for filariases and, as such, represents a significant advance. As the authors note, however, a considerable amount of work remains to be done to bring this assay to",342,11, ready-to-use status for a field setting.
813,0,28575,0,"Day: August 25, 2014

The August 31 schedules will see a return to fall service across the system as well as several other changes. At long last (I have been distracted with other events, and there was a lot to do this month) here is the consolidated list of service changes. The list combines all types of change because there are overlapping seasonal, construction and service improvement effects.

The table linked here has been updated to correct errors missed in its creation. Thanks to Timor Urakov for catching these.

Something I have not included here, but will add in a future update, is a list of all of the Standby Buses (and a few streetcars) that are spotted around the city for various reasons. They don’t show up in the route-by-route info, but there is a substantial chunk of the fleet used to provide this service. Due to a bus shortage, the number of standby vehicles scheduled for fall 2014 is lower than originally planned.

510 Spadina

Streetcars will return to Spadina between Bloor and Queens Quay with all service running through to the south end of the line. The route will be scheduled based on CLRV capacity, and new Flexities will take over runs one by one as cars become available. Current plans are for through service to Union and a resumption of streetcar service on 509 Harbourfront in October.

At the end of the AM Peak, 508 Lake Shore trippers operate a westbound trip as 506 Carlton to provide extra capacity to the UofT St. George campus. These trips previously operated back to Roncesvalles Carhouse, but they will be changed so that the cars switch over to 510 Spadina which has more cars during the midday than the AM peak.

Previously, this interlining was done using 503 Kingston Road cars from Russell, but with the move of 510 Spadina to Roncesvalles, trippers from that division will be used.

504 King Running Time Changes

In an attempt to reduce the need to short turn much of the service to keep operators on time, the TTC is changing the round trip times during all periods of service on this route.

In the table above, the “before” times are shown under “Aug” and are taken from the schedules in effect until Aug. 30. The “after” times are shown under “Sept” and are taken from the schedules effective Aug. 31.

The time is given as running time plus recovery time. For example, the AM peak running time of “120+8” means that cars will have 120 minutes of driving time to make a round trip plus 8 minutes of terminal recovery time. Some of the changes increase the total time by 20%, a very substantial increase.

Whether this will translate into a noticeable reduction in short turns remains to be seen. One potential problem will be the accumulation of “early” cars at terminals where it is already possible to find lineups of cars. From my own knowledge of the line, some of these changes appear to be excessive and will probably have to be rolled back.

501 Queen & 508 Lake Shore

From September through December, reconstruction of the Gardiner Expressway at Humber Loop will close off the underpass between the loop and Lake Shore Blvd. The outer end of the Queen route will once again switch to a shuttle bus connecting with the streetcar.

Subway Changes

Yonge subway operations will be changed to base more trains at Davisville Yard. This will give more time for maintenance work as the last service trains will be clear of the line sooner than on current schedules. An early morning non-revenue train that carries Station Collectors to work will be replaced with a shuttle bus.

On the Bloor subway, service will be improved weekday middays and evenings, and on Saturday afternoons to reduce crowding.

Roncesvalles Yard

In anticipation of the arrival of more Flexities, some runs will be shifted to other locations. Exhibition Loop will now be used to store some 511 Bathurst runs as well as 512 St. Clair runs already at that location.

The 510 Spadina route will operate from Ronces",890,11,"valles where the Flexities will be based,"

As before, there’s no need to refresh the table view! It’s all handled by the fetched results controller, which notifies the controller that changes have occured.

Build and run, add a few banks, and swipe one of the cells to show the delete button. Tap the button, and you’ll see the record deleted and the table view refreshed!

Editing Banks

At this point, new banks are added using “static” content. Now you’ll incorporate the ability to edit the details of a bank. To handle this, you’ll build a new view controller.

Right-click on the project root and select New File/Cocoa Touch/Objective-C Class. Name the controller SMBankDetailViewController and make it a subclass of UIViewController. Also make sure that a XIB is generated.

Now open SMBankDetailViewController.xib to add a few components. The view will be pushed by a view controller, so you might want to visualize the space taken by a navigation bar. With the view selected, tap the fourth icon in the inspector (the right sidebar) and set the top bar to “Navigation Bar.”

Then drag four text fields and two labels to the view, and lay them out as in the following screenshot:

You might want to edit the placeholder text of the input fields so it’s clear what’s what – you can use the above screenshot as a reference. Later on in this tutorial, you’ll set the tags on the labels as well.

While you’re at it, add a date picker component. This will be displayed when necessary via code to edit dates.

For the moment, place the picker outside of the visible area of the view. The Y of the picker should be set to 420. With the picker selected, switch to the Size Inspector tab on the right sidebar and set its position as follows:

Now it’s time to write some code to display the new view. In SMBankDetailViewController.h, add the following import statements below the existing #import line:

#import ""FailedBankInfo.h"" #import ""FailedBankDetails.h""

Then add the following properties and methods before the final @end:

@property (nonatomic, strong) FailedBankInfo *bankInfo; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UITextField *nameField; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UITextField *cityField; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UITextField *zipField; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UITextField *stateField; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UILabel *tagsLabel; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UILabel *dateLabel; @property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UIDatePicker *datePicker; -(id)initWithBankInfo:(FailedBankInfo *) info;

Next, in SMBankDetailViewController.xib, hook up each outlet you defined with its corresponding component. You can do this by selecting the File’s Owner (which is the SMBankDetailViewController class), switching to the Connections Inspector in the right sidebar, and dragging from each outlet to the relevant control on the view.

At the top of SMBankDetailViewController.m, right below the @implementation line, synthesize all the properties as follows:

816,0,29116,0,"President Obama in Latin America: Put Hugo Chavez on the Agenda

About the Author

President Obama undertakes his March 19–23 trip to Latin America at a time when the international scene is in enormous flux. In three stops—Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador—the President will send an upbeat message of equal partnership and offer broader U.S. engagement in Latin America.

President Obama will meet with three leaders whose views count when it comes to the state of democracy in the Americas. White House strategists claim to see connections between the democratic transitions that occurred in Latin America in the 1980s and the current aspirations for democracy in the Arab world. There is a danger, however, that the President will overlook the imminent threat to democracy and security posed by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Raising the Chavez threat while in Latin America may not be on the President’s agenda, but it should be.

Missing: A Chavez Strategy

In 2008, Dan Restrepo, then an analyst at the Center for American Progress, advised Washington policymakers to cease “obsessing” about Chavez.[1] Today Restrepo, senior director for Latin America at the National Security Council, argues that Chavez’s influence is on the wane and optimistically predicts that the President’s visit will make life harder for Chavez and those “who try to make a living on an anti-American sentiment.”

Despite an unscheduled and friendly encounter between Chavez and Obama at the April 2009 Summit of the Americas, relations between the two countries continue to sour. Since 2009, Chavez has worked overtime to marginalize, silence, exile, or jail political opponents. He has virtually obliterated all traditional checks and balances, concentrating power in his own hands.

The September 2010 legislative election in Venezuela demonstrated the strength of Chavez’s opposition, however. It shattered the illusion that Chavez governs with a consistent majority. Following the election, Chavez moved further to constrain customary democratic practices by employing decree laws. A polarized Venezuela faces growing domestic challenges that range from mounting crime and inflation rates to curtailments of fundamental freedoms. Chavez has engineered what Council of the Americas expert Chris Sabatini labels “an anti-institutional revolution that leaves behind a lawless black hole” that concerns the entire region.

Although the Administration restored relations at the ambassadorial level in 2009, they have again deteriorated following the withdrawal of U.S. Ambassador Patrick Duddy. Chavez very publicly rejected the Obama Administration’s nominee Larry Palmer for making comments that the Venezuelan leader deemed disrespectful. In December 2010, the State Department revoked the diplomatic visa of Venezuelan Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez, creating the current diplomatic impasse.

Chavez Uses Soft and Hard Power

Chavez has poured billions of dollars of Venezuela’s substantial oil wealth into advancing “socialism of the 21st century.” He has bankrolled an assortment of leftist anti-American leaders who belong to his Bolivarian Alternative for Our America (ALBA), an alliance committed to socialism, nationalism, populism, authoritarianism, and anti-Americanism.

Chavez was the intellectual architect of the political confrontation that resulted in the removal of Honduran president Manuel Zelaya from office in June 2009 for his Chavez-like attempt to alter constitutional rules. He is the primary backer of Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, who moves to claim an irregular extension of his rule in November. In tandem with Fidel and Raul Castro, Chavez has constructed a tighter alliance that helps the Cuban dictators preserve their outdated revolutionary credo and disastrously underproductive command economy. Chavez’s assistance lacks transparency and is politically directed to influence potential voters in the region.

Chavez’s quest for hard power is reflected in his continued acquisition of an arsenal of Russian-made weapons in the range of $7 billion to $10 billion. While security relations have thus far been symbolic—warship and bomber visits—the potential for a Venezuela–Russia tandem in the event of a flare-up adds to tension between the U.S. and Russia. Russia has also offered to help Venezuela start a nuclear program.

regulation, and a prohibition on name changes in his argument should be summarily rejected.

The State argues that it cannot enforce a proximity restriction unless a violation of that statute

occurs and defendant has not been charged with a violation of that statute, and also that the

regulations are not criminal offenses. The State further contends that this court recently found

that a registrant under SORA does not have standing to attack even the penalty provision of

SORA where there is no allegation of noncompliance, citing In re A.C., 2016 IL App (1st)

¶ 30   The State misstates the lack of standing finding of In re A.C., 2016 IL App (1st) 153047.

In that case, this court found that the respondent lacked standing because he was not suffering or

in immediate danger of suffering a direct injury as a result of enforcement of section 10 of

SORA (730 ILCS 150/10 (West 2014)) because there was no allegation that respondent failed to

comply with the registration required under SORA and was being charged with a felony. In re

A.C., 2016 IL App (1st) 153047, ¶ 24. This court noted that unlike in Avila-Briones, application

of the ""penalty"" provision of section 10 was not automatically being applied as it first required

that respondent fail to abide by the registration requirements, and then he must be charged with a

violation and convicted after a trial. In re A.C., 2016 IL App (1st) 153047, ¶ 24.

818,0,20244,0,"President Franklin Roosevelt made it law in 1938, that any hourly worker had to be paid at least 25 cents an hour. It was revolutionary, and very few countries had anything like it.

Every few years, the federal minimum wage would go up, helping millions of Americans inch closer to a middle-class lifestyle. Something changed in the early 1970s, however, and since then, the minimum wage has fallen by around 25 percent.

Fast-forward to today. The minimum wage is currently $7.25. But in 1968, you’d make the equivalent of $10 an hour in today’s money. Basically the same group, but they have 30 percent less buying power.





On Tuesday night, during his State of the Union address, President Obama made the following statement:

“Even with the tax relief we’ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That’s wrong. Let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty.”

His proposal would see the federal floor on hourly wages reach $9 in stages by the end of 2015. Tying the minimum wage to inflation would allow it to rise along with the cost of living. If enacted, the measure would boost the wages of about 15 million low-income workers, the White House estimated. The $9 minimum wage would be the highest in more than three decades, accounting for inflation, but still lower than the peaks reached in the 1960s and 1970s.

The White House said that the move would have profoundly positive effects for low-income families without unduly burdening businesses or raising the unemployment rate. It cited research showing no detectable employment losses from the kind of minimum wage increases we have seen in the United States.

But according to Fox News’ Bret Baier, and guest Nina Easton, the answer is a big “yes” – increasing the minimum wage will hurt employment and the economy. Anchoring Fox’s State of the Union coverage, Baier said that small businesses and Republicans typically push back on minimum wage hikes because of the old myth that “it will lead companies to cut back, lay people off, and not expand business.”

Nothing can be further from the truth.

In fact, studies show that raising the minimum wage does not result in higher unemployment.

In a March 2011 report, the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that raising the minimum wage has no “discernible impact” on employment. CEPR concluded that wage increases are more likely to result in more, rather than fewer, jobs:

“The results for fast food, food services, retail, and low-wage establishments in San Francisco and Santa Fe support the view that a citywide minimum wages can raise the earnings of low-wage workers, without a discernible impact on their employment. Moreover, the lack of an employment response held for three full years after the implementation of the measures, allaying concerns that the shorter time periods examined in some of the earlier research on the minimum wage was not long enough to capture the true disemployment effects. Our estimated employment responses generally cluster near zero, and are more likely to be positive than negative. Few of our point estimates are precise enough to rule out either positive or negative employment effects, but statistically significant positive employment responses outnumber statistically significant negative elasticities.”

Finally, the system errors induced by the angle of polarizers and spliced points are discussed, and the variation trends of intensities are obtained for different HOIs.",126,11,"

820,0,22366,0,"Is it 1) an environment where applications and processes exist both in the public and private cloud and on premise? Or is it 2) a combination public/private cloud without an on-premise component?

For the sake of this discussion, we’ll concede definition 1. Clarifying this concept is important because the vast majority of cloud-adopting organizations — which is to say the vast majority of organizations, period — are about to become hybrid-cloud-adopting organizations, and for good reason: they’re not ready to simply switch off their existing on-premise systems — legacy systems that already have significant business and operational value — and re-invent them in the cloud.

Let’s concretize this hybrid notion with a simple example of a business process nearly all organizations are familiar with: the HR onboarding process.

1. Onboarding begins. A cloud-based recruiting system like Taleo is used to identify a candidate. When the candidate is hired, the business process moves from the cloud-based recruiting system to the on-premise HR system.

2. Onboarding continues. The candidate is given systems access, login credentials, and an e-mail account. IT is cued to furnish the candidate with a laptop and other equipment. The office manager assigns the candidate an office space.

3. Onboarding concludes. HR moves the business process back to the cloud by using a cloud-based performance-management system like SumTotal, where new-hire details are updated.

Cloud. On-premise. Cloud again.

This isn’t some supposed future scenario. This hybridized process is happening now, throughout most organizations, and in many other departments besides HR. To ensure the success of those departments in a hybrid cloud environment, organizations should address three key issues: security, service level agreements (SLAs), and application integration.

Security

The move to the cloud does mean that security and data privacy — something that was previously your IT department’s concern — is now your cloud provider’s concern. Yet it doesn’t mean your organization is absolved from ensuring that the cloud provider is doing its part. You need to demand that the cloud provider is clear about how they secure and protect your customers’, partners’, and employees’ data — both when it’s stored in the cloud and when it’s transferred to and from your on-premise systems.

A cloud-based application in isolation is reason enough for insisting on a clear understanding of how your cloud provider stores your data. Imagine, then, how imperative a clear understanding becomes when that cloud-based application is no longer isolated but integrated into a hybrid cloud environment. It’s now transferring data out into the world — perhaps from an Amazon data center in Europe or the Pacific Northwest to your offices on the other side of the globe. Or perhaps it’s transferring data to your trading partner’s systems, where you have much less control over security and protection.

This spawns several questions you should ask your cloud provider:

• Is the data encrypted both when it’s in motion and at rest?

• If cloud-application access is via an application programming interface (API), is the security token secured and encrypted when it’s used in the API core?

• What’s the security token’s lifetime? Is it per-session or permanent?

• How easily could this security token be hijacked and reused?

• Is the security token tied to IP addresses?

Getting solid answers to important questions like these will ensure that the cloud part of your hybrid environment is always serving your business and never compromising the strength of its security profile.

He slowly puts his hand through the mass of squirming insects and removes it a few seconds later, totally unharmed. The next time, he goes back in, he pulls off a huge of chunk of them, almost like the whole cluster was a liquid, like he was running his hands through a loosely cohesive whole.

Scrolling down through the comments, I hoped to find some sort of an explanation. And I found it. Someone wrote about how when you find bees attached to a tree or some other object, it means that they’re swarming, that they don’t have a queen to protect, and that they’re incredibly docile. It all made sense as far as I could tell, I mean, I’m no beekeeper, but this was proof, right?

So when my wife called me outside a few months later, she was screaming, “Rob! Come outside, come quick!” I went out back and she was standing twenty feet away from the garage. “Look Rob, there’s some sort of a beehive.” And it was just like I saw on the video, there were tons of them, all clustered in the top left corner.

I said to my wife, “You want to see something cool?” and I was just going do it, like I’d run my hands through and my wife would be all scared but after a while she’d see that I wasn’t being hurt. How would she react? She’d probably start asking a bunch of half-questions, like, “But … how? This … what?” and I’d just laugh, making up some nonsense answer like, “It’s all about confidence. These bees are more afraid of you than you are of them. You need to project strong vibes, and they’ll understand that. They don’t speak English, but body language a universal means of communication.”

So I calmly walked toward the hive. “Rob? What are you doing, Rob?” to which I replied, “Babe, I’ve got it. Don’t worry.” And that whole confidence, posture, body language thing, it totally worked on my wife. She saw me chill out, she started chilling out herself. “All right, just be careful.

Sexual Harassment: Punishments to Fit the Crime

12/19/2017 09:50 am ETUpdated
Jan 02, 2018

Sexual harassment, in all its forms, including milder ones, is abusive and offensive and should be penalized. However, in all bodies of ethics and criminal codes, we distinguish among various levels of the same offense and tailor the punishment to fit the level of the crime. Catholic theory distinguishes between venial and mortal sins; Jewish teaching requires minding 613 dos and don’ts, though one should only risk one’s life only for three of them. We do not punish people the same for murders; we are much harsher for premeditated murder (first degree) than for involuntary manslaughter. The same goes for the different treatment of those convicted of aggravated versus “common assault.”

Sexual harassment acts also differ significantly from one another and hence call for different levels of punishment. At the worse end of the continuum is use of force, in rape. It should be treated severely like all violent crimes. Lesser uses of force—forceful kissing, groping—nevertheless cross a line that separates sex violence from other forms of sexual harassment. They make people feel violated and disempowered.

On the less severe end of the continuum—still abusive and warranting punishment—are affronts that are strictly verbal. Asking repeatedly for sexual encounters for those who have refused; commenting on another person’s relevant body parts, cat calls, and ogling. Each is troubling and can cause a hostile work or social environment. However, while the use of force leaves the victim no choice—verbal communication allows one to respond appropriately—or counter them with a cold shoulder. One can repeat to oneself, “Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will not hurt me.”

Close to outright coercive behavior is the use of power. Any indication that the offender threatened to deny the victim a promotion, a job, opportunities for stardom or publication—should be treated much more seriously than mere verbal assaults. Some micro-aggression mavens will argue that such a power differential exists in all cross",464,11,"-gender relationships. However, I refer to specific application"

827,0,21216,0,"""Love Wins""? No, just the will of five judicial despots and the Rainbow Mafia.

1-2-3-4-5. Five leftist lawyers, currently abusing their authority as Supreme Court Justices, unleashed their activism upon the U.S. Constitution Friday and created a non-existent right to same-sex marriage. The Fourteenth Amendment may provide equal protection under the law, but by applying it to expand the definition of marriage the Court has created a constitutional crisis in America. The First and Tenth Amendments, which respectively promise freedom of individual religion and award jurisdiction to the States of all powers not enumerated in the Constitution, have now been placed in direct conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.

“Love Wins”? Not here it doesn’t, nor does anything but the will of five judicial despots, followed by the bullying mob rule of the Left and its Rainbow Mafia. Need proof?

In 2008, before the Saul Alinsky-ite Barack Obama and his Chicagoland gang occupied the White House and began “fundamentally transforming” our nation, there was debate, dissent and dialogue about all sorts of issues, including those issues fomented by the hard Left in order to label the response of the Christian Right as extremist.

In 2008, homosexual couples could enter into a legal, binding contract for shared property, power of attorney for making health care decisions, probate of wills, etc., and were, in most cases, receiving health care benefits from employers. These same homosexual couples were consummating their relationship in the privacy of their own domicile without harassment.

In 2008, Christians could speak their opinions and stand on their faith while understanding their voice was respected in the public square.

In 2015, however, those same Christians are in grave danger of losing legal standing because their beliefs are pitted against a brand new, heretofore undiscovered constitutional right. Tolerance is only for those who agree with the mob-rule Left.

What changed in seven years?

If you ask a moderate Republican, he or she might say, “Elections have consequences,” and shrug, since they never viewed this as meaningful anyway. If you ask the Bible-believing Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan, they shudder at the exchange of timeless principles for sexual license. If you ask a libertarian, you might get the response that devout Christians are the “recalcitrant minority.” But if you ask someone who identifies as Christian first, American second, and is conservative politically, you’ll hear sorrow for a nation that worships the secular triune of me, myself and I rather than our Creator.

829,0,21955,0,"A normal ear transmits sounds as shown in FIG. 1 through the outer ear 101 to the tympanic membrane (eardrum) 102, which moves the bones of the middle ear 103 (malleus, incus, and stapes) that vibrate the oval window and round window openings of the cochlea 104. The cochlea 104 is a long narrow duct wound spirally about its axis for approximately two and a half turns. It includes an upper channel known as the scala vestibuli and a lower channel known as the scala tympani, which are connected by the cochlear duct. The cochlea 104 forms an upright spiraling cone with a center called the modiolar where the spiral ganglion cells of the acoustic nerve 113 reside. In response to received sounds transmitted by the middle ear 103, the fluid-filled cochlea 104 functions as a transducer to generate electric pulses which are transmitted to the cochlear nerve 113, and ultimately to the brain.
Hearing is impaired when there are problems in the ability to transduce external sounds into meaningful action potentials along the neural substrate of the cochlea 104. To improve impaired hearing, auditory prostheses have been developed. For example, when the impairment is related to operation of the middle ear 103, a conventional hearing aid may be used to provide acoustic-mechanical stimulation to the auditory system in the form of amplified sound. Or when the impairment is associated with the cochlea 104, a cochlear implant with an implanted stimulation electrode can electrically stimulate auditory nerve tissue with small currents delivered by multiple electrode contacts distributed along the electrode.

831,0,29183,0,"More than 1,090 people across the country have been infected by the super contagious measles virus in ongoing outbreaks since January.

In New York, the virus has been spreading since September, mostly among Orthodox Jews, some of whom reject vaccines because of unfounded safety concerns. In Washington, mistrust of health officials and pharmaceutical companies drove parents in one county to opt out there — sparking another large outbreak. All together, measles clusters have sprung up in 28 states.

These outbreaks will cost states and the federal government millions of dollars to contain. They’ll distract from other important public health programs. Most importantly, they’ll put people who can’t be immunized — newborn babies, kids with vaccine allergies — at risk.

But here’s the most frustrating part: This is all entirely avoidable. By 2000, thanks to the measles vaccine, the virus was declared eliminated in the US. It’s absurd that outbreaks have reappeared, yet there’s one little discussed reason why: Too many states make it way too easy for parents to avoid vaccines on behalf of their kids. In other words, measles is making a comeback in part because of a policy failure.

Most of the people with measles right now weren’t immunized from the virus. Many live in places that permit a variety of nonmedical — religious or philosophical — exemptions from vaccines.

That’s now changing. Responding to these outbreaks, lawmakers in Washington, Maine and New York passed legislation in 2019 eliminating either personal or philosophical exemptions for vaccines — or both.

But other states, like Mississippi and West Virginia, closed their loopholes years ago; their vaccine coverage rates are higher and they haven’t had to deal with any outbreaks lately.

Researchers have repeatedly shown that when you make it easier for parents to avoid vaccines, they take advantage — and vaccine exemptions rise. The reverse is also true: making it harder to opt out can drive up vaccine rates, a new JAMA analysis of California’s recent move to outlaw all but medical exemptions shows.

So if we want to prevent dangerous, costly, and needless outbreaks — like the half-dozen going on now across the country — we need to make it harder for parents to opt out.

When measles vaccine coverage drops below 95 percent, “outbreaks are inevitable”

Before we get into the wonky details of state vaccine policies, let’s pause for a refresher on why measles immunization is so essential.

It’s not an overstatement to say that measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man. When people aren’t immunized, it’s extremely easy to catch measles. In an unvaccinated population, one person with measles can infect 12 to 18 others. That’s way higher than other viruses like Ebola, HIV, or SARS. (With Ebola, one case usually leads to two others. With HIV and SARS, one case usually leads to another four.)

In the US, before a vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were 4 million measles cases, with 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths in the US every year. Measles was also a leading killer of children globally.

These days, with two doses, the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective in individuals. But for the vaccine to protect the population, including the small number of people who can’t be vaccinated, we need what’s known as herd immunity. Depending on the virus, a certain percentage of people needs to be immunized to keep a disease from spreading through populations (what’s called “herd immunity.”) Because measles spreads so easily, the percentage needed for herd immunity is really high.

“As soon as [measles] vaccination coverage drops below 95 percent,” Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, warned in a recent CNN article, “outbreaks are inevitable.” That means nearly everybody in a community who can get the vaccine needs to be accounted for to stop the virus from spreading.

The era of lax vaccine policies has to end

But state legislators have put policies in place that, in many cases, make it too easy for parents to opt out of vaccines.

It was actually measles outbreaks in the 1960s that inspired a push to have states require children get inoculated before starting kindergarten. By the 1980s, all states had mandatory immunization laws in place. The idea",938,11, behind these laws was simple: Near-universal vaccinations sustain

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
In each of these four appeals,
appellant Gregorio Rodriguez appeals his conviction on an open plea of guilty
and resulting sentence.
Offenses
committed on December 21, 2008:
In appellate case number 07-10-0172-CR, appellant was convicted of
evading arrest or detention with a vehicle and sentenced to 18 months in a
state jail facility;[1]
In appellate case number 07-10-0122-CR, appellant was convicted of
possession of marijuana of less than two ounces in a drug free zone and
sentenced to 12 months in the Lubbock County Jail.[2]
Offenses committed on October 25,
2009:
In appellate case number 07-10-0171-CR, appellant was convicted of
possession of a controlled substance listed in penalty group 1, cocaine of less
than one gram and sentenced to 24 months in a state jail facility;[3]
In appellate case number 07-10-0123-CR, appellant was convicted of
driving while intoxicated and sentenced to 6 months in the Lubbock County Jail.[4]
In each case, appellant’s
court-appointed appellate attorney has filed a motion to withdraw from
representation supported by an Anders
brief.[5]  Agreeing with counsel’s conclusion that the
record fails to show any arguably meritorious issue capable of supporting an
appeal, we grant the motion to withdraw in each case and affirm the trial
court’s judgments.
Punishment hearing testimony showed
that on December 21, 2008, a police officer saw a vehicle driving
erratically.  The officer attempted a
traffic stop.  As the officer followed
the vehicle, he saw a person leap from the vehicle while it remained in
motion.  The vehicle then jumped a curb,
knocked down a fence, and collided with a parked vehicle in a driveway.  The location of the accident was within 1,000
feet of a public school.  When the
officer entered the passenger compartment to turn off the ignition and place
the transmission in park, he saw an open container of alcohol.  An officer later also found a baggy
containing what he believed was marijuana. 
Police eventually were able to identify appellant as the person

We present a method to identify HOI readily by altering the spliced angle between the polarizers' pigtails and PMF under test with WLI system, which is verified by a simple case of two coupling points along a PMF experimentally. Finally, the system errors induced by the angle of polarizers and spliced points are discussed, and the variation trends of intensities are obtained for different HOIs.

836,0,23333,0,"Teachers and school systems fear running afoul of the gateway law, which allows teachers to be fined up to $500 for discussing “gateway sexual activity” in the classroom.

Within the last year, Knox County has begun offering a voluntary training video to educators made by the county health department. The video features local experts in abuse treatment explaining how predators operate, why kids don’t tell, and indicators of sexual abuse.

Five years after the Tennessee legislature slammed the gate on classroom conversations about any sexual activity, some are questioning whether this “gateway law” also locked out sexual abuse prevention. Despite a subsequent law encouraging schools to teach about sexual abuse, many still don’t, potentially leaving children without tools to protect themselves.

The question has become more pressing as recent lawsuits and police investigations of sexual assaults among students in Tennessee have made headlines nationally. This summer, an elite private school failed to report or respond to a student’s allegations of being raped by other students in a locker room; a similar East Tennessee case involving high school basketball team members has been winding its way through the courts for the last year. In Knoxville in 2016, two high school administrators were suspended for failing to promptly report a student receiving sexually explicit pictures from a coach’s wife, who this fall pleaded guilty to statutory rape.

These cases have exposed gaps in schools’ understanding of the legal requirement to promptly report sexual abuse and assault. They also highlight how little is taught to public school students or staff about sexual abuse prevention—despite a 2014 state law that endorsed (but did not require) adding it to the curriculum.

Reluctance to teach sexual abuse prevention is at least partly due to teachers’ and school systems’ fear of running afoul of the gateway law, which allows teachers to be fined up to $500 for discussing “gateway sexual activity” in the classroom. Advocates of the gateway law had claimed concern about children being taught details of oral sex or sex between people of the same gender, so in 2012 the law went into effect, establishing curriculum, what teachers can say, and how they can be punished for saying more.

Sex. Abortion. Parenthood. Power. The latest news, delivered straight to your inbox. SUBSCRIBE

“Folks are still unclear about the limits of this law,” said Tory Mills, external affairs manager at Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee. “We have to create an environment where kids feel like they can report these things and be able to say the words of what has happened to them,” she said. “But we are creating an environment of distrust. The law is absolutely one piece of this, because we think teachers are really afraid of talking about sex health topics.”

Tennessee law currently limits sex education to an “abstinence-centered” curriculum—which sexual health educators say is not effective—and even that isn’t required except in counties with a high teen birth rate (where there are more than 19.5 pregnancies per 1,000 girls under age 18). More than half the school districts that met the criteria in 2017 are in the Appalachian counties of the state, and almost all are rural.

Erin’s Law and Preventing Sexual Abuse

About 1 in 4 girls, and 1 in 6 boys, suffer sexual abuse, according to research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and distributed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The law supporting sexual abuse prevention in schools is often called “Erin’s Law,” after childhood sexual assault survivor and activist Erin Merryn. Merryn’s campaign to educate children, teachers, and parents about sexual abuse has led to laws in 31 states. Tennessee’s version is weaker than the requirements in states like Connecticut, Maryland, and Louisiana, which mandate some combination of sexual abuse prevention coursework for all staff, age-appropriate lessons for students, and a clear system for children to report sexual abuse.

The Tennessee Department of Education provided schools with recommendations about curricula and resources that could be used to teach both children and staff about recognizing and preventing sexual abuse. But Cary Rayson, community engagement coordinator at Prevent Child Abuse Tennessee, where part of her job is to educate adults about child sexual abuse, noted that no funding was attached to Erin’s Law to implement the lessons. And according to Chandler Hopper, deputy",931,11," director of communications for the education department, it doesn�"

Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996), the Supreme Court repudiated language in earlier case law and explained that state actors have no duty to assure that prisoners can litigate claims effectively once they have been raised in court. The right to access, goes no further than access.
It must be acknowledged that several statements in Bounds went beyond the right of access recognized in the earlier cases on which it relied, which was a right to bring to court a grievance that the inmate wished to present.... These statements appear to suggest that the State must enable the prisoner to discover grievances, and to litigate effectively once in court.... These elaborations upon the right of access to the courts have no antecedent in our pre-Bounds cases, and we now disclaim them.

846,0,25225,0,"REGISTRY POLICY FOR DETERMINING THE EXTENT
TO WHICH AN ACCUSED IS ABLE TO REMUNERATE COUNSEL

1
Entry into force

This policy applies from 4 May 2004

2
General provisions

Without prejudice to discretion afforded by
Article 8 of the Directive on Assignment of Defence Counsel
(""Directive""), the Registry uses the following policy
to determine the extent to which an applicant for legal aid
is able to remunerate counsel. When an applicant for legal aid
submits a declaration of means pursuant to Article 7(B) of the
Directive, the Registry assesses the income and assets of the
applicant, his spouse and the persons with whom he habitually
resides. In doing so the Registry may rely on the applicant’s
declaration of means or undertake an inquiry into the applicant’s
means pursuant to Article 10 of the Directive. From the established
pool of income and assets, the Registry calculates the applicant’s
disposable means, according to Sections 5-8 of this policy.
From the disposable means, the Registry deducts the estimated
living expenses of the applicant’s family and dependents during
the estimated period in which the applicant will require representation
before the International Tribunal. The amount remaining is the
contribution to be made by the applicant to his defence.

3
Legislative Authority

The legislative authority for this policy is
enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 of the Directive.

4
Definitions

Under this policy, the following terms shall
mean:

Accused: a person against whom one or more
counts in his indictment have been confirmed in accordance with
Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence;

Applicant: an accused who has applied for
legal aid before the International Tribunal;

Child: a person under 18 years of age who
habitually resides in the principal family home;

Contribution: the extent to which an applicant
is able to remunerate counsel. That is, the amount the applicant
is expected to contribute to his defence;

Dependent: a person who derives his or her
main financial support from the applicant, his spouse or persons
with whom he habitually resides but who does not habitually
reside in the principal family home;

Disposable means: income and assets of
the applicant, his spouse and the persons with whom he habitually
resides that in the opinion of the Registry exceed the reasonable
needs of the applicant, his spouse, his dependents and the persons
with whom he habitually resides. The Registry’s calculation
of the disposable means is based on Sections 5-8 of this policy;

Estimated living expenses:

the living costs likely to be incurred
by the applicant, his spouse, his dependents and the persons
with whom he habitually resides during the period from when
the Registry issues its decision on the extent to which an applicant
is able to remunerate counsel until the conclusion of the estimated
period in which the applicant will require representation before
the International Tribunal, as calculated under Section 10 of
this policy;

Marital property: Property acquired by the
applicant and his spouse during their marital union, excluding
gifts made to one spouse specifically;

Persons with whom he habitually resides:

individuals who usually live with the applicant
or who would live with the applicant if he were not in custody,
and with whom the applicant is financially",757,11," co-dependent; meaning,

847,0,22209,0,"Normalization of OpenIDs URLs

To a lay person (or even your average geek), these URLs all represent the same thing — especially if you type any of them into the address bar, they’ll land you on my out-of-date homepage.

But, in the land of OpenID and URI evaluation, these differences can be very significant, especially when you get into the differences between OpenID v1.1 and the forthcoming v2.0 (which adds support for inames).

I’m going to fix the trailing slash issue on URL-based OpenIDs. We’ll be more liberal in what we take.

This should mean that folks logging in with OpenID shouldn’t have to guess at what their appropriate identity URL looks like, instead only substantively know what the important parts are (i.e. the domain and any sub-domain or path(s)).

Outstanding issues: Of course, 37 Signals can do this, but what happens when the identity URL that someone uses on Highrise doesn’t work elsewhere because other consumers aren’t as liberal with what they accept?

Lack of support for i-names

I’ve heard that there’s somewhere in the ballpark of 20,000 i-names users in the wild (I happen to have =chris.messina but never use it), but compared with the over 70 million (and growing) URL-based OpenID users, this is an incredibly small minority of the overall OpenID landscape.

Nevertheless, one potential point of frustration for these users is in the lack of standardization in implementing or indicating support for i-names, as Rod Begbiepointed out in the Highrise forum, to which DHHreplied,. We don’t support iname OpenIDs for now, though. We’re just supporting OpenID 1.1.

And this, I imagine, is going to be a common issue, for both OpenID implementors (dealing with support requests for support of i-names) and for i-names users, such that I question, as others have, the wisdom of offering support for i-names identifiers, when issues still clearly remain in the usability of basic URLs.

Remedy: Once the OpenID v2.0 spec has been finalized, there will need to be a new logo to indicate which version of OpenID a consuming site supports; this will hopefully work to set expectations for i-names users.

Outstanding issues: At the same time, the addition of i-names to OpenID v2.0 has caused a lot of concern for folks, many of whom have simply decided to stick with v1.1.

Personally, I don’t see the long term value in fragmenting the OpenID protocol away from more familiar URL-based",601,11," identifiers. I want something simple, straightforward and obvious."

Plus, while some issues do bother me about an EVF, there are things I really like about it. And the lenses that really tempt me for a FF camera would set me back quite a bit. When people complain about the cost of m4/3 lenses, I wonder if they have priced top shelf Canon or Nikon lenses.

3. Adapted lenses are much more compact on the 5D than the EM5 because of the flange distance. OM mount lenses on the 5D are super compact. Love this. OM mount lenses on the EM5 look like ungainly protrusions.

Click to expand...

of course the standoff required to suite flange distance makes lenses less than 50mm sortof pointless on the m43 now that we have such good native fixed focal lengths (that 14, 20, 25 and 45mm simply weren't there in 2009) of course this varies depending if you are using leica M mount lenses or OM lenses (which have huge focal flange distances).

I went OM after starting on FD for exactly the reason that it would work on EOS... but now I've mostly lost 99% of my interest in a 5D as I have become comfortable with knowing that the FF provides me (in what I do) very little.

In the meantime, I'm open to hearing reasons why I should keep the 5D.

Do you ever shoot in low light? Do you need the resolution / do you ever print large? Do you ever shoot in situations that you need the ergonomics of the 5D? Do you even like the ergonomics of the 5D? Do you have a thing for canon glass?

If you didn't answer ""yes"" to any of these, why did you get a 5D?

The 5DIII is a little ""behind"" on sensor tech compared to your other major FF options (Sony, Nikon), the biggest thing that I notice (apart from resolution) when comparing my EM1 and my A7r, but that I don't see in your ""Pro's"" list is dynamic range. You can pull a lot more out of the A7r/D800's shadows, highlights and overall exposure. I'm not sure exactly how the 5D",509,11," compares, but I don't think it's favorable."

Discussion
==========

Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue lesions or nodules that are similar to the endometrium but are present at sites outside the uterus \[[@B3]\]. Common sites of endometriosis include the ovaries, pelvic viscera and the peritoneum and the presentations can vary from a few minimal lesions on pelvic organs to massive endometric ovary cysts or even extensive adhesions involving subperitoneal spaces, intestinal system, and urinary system \[[@B4][@B5]\].

Rare cases of extrapelvic endometriosis may result from vascular or lymphatic dissemination of endometrial cells to many gynecologic and non gynecologic sites. It has been reported that endometriosis of the skin and soft tissue makes up about 3.5% of cases of extrapelvic endometriosis with a majority of such cases occurring in surgical scars following operations of the uterus \[[@B5][@B6][@B7]\].

Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods are used to develop varieties from breeding populations. Breeding programs combine desirable traits from two or more varieties or various broad-based sources into breeding pools from which varieties are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. The new varieties are evaluated to determine which have commercial potential.
Pedigree breeding is commonly used for the improvement of self-pollinating crops. Two parents which possess favorable, complementary traits are crossed to produce an F1. An F2 population is produced by selfing one or several F1's. Selection of the best individuals may begin in the F2 population (or later depending upon the breeders objectives); then, beginning in the F3, the best individuals in the best families can be selected. Replicated testing of families can begin in the F3 or F4 generation to improve the effectiveness of selection for traits with low heritability. At an advanced stage of inbreeding (i.e., F6 and F7), the best lines or mixtures of phenotypically similar lines are tested for potential release as new varieties.
Mass and recurrent selections can be used to improve populations of either self-or cross-pollinating crops. A genetically variable population of heterozygous individuals is either identified or created by intercrossing several different parents. The best plants are selected based on individual superiority, outstanding progeny, or excellent combining ability. The selected plants are intercrossed to produce a new population in which further cycles of selection are continued.
Backcross breeding has been used to transfer genetic loci for simply inherited, highly heritable traits into a desirable homozygous variety which is the recurrent parent. The source of the trait to be transferred is called the donor or nonrecurrent parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., variety) and the desirable trait transferred from the donor parent. After the initial cross, individuals possessing the phenotype of the donor parent are selected and repeatedly crossed (backcrossed) to the recurrent parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e",452,11,".g., variety) and the desirable trait transferred from"

LEIGH M. CLARK, Supernumerary Circuit Judge.
This is an appeal from a conviction of rape and a sentence to the penitentiary for ten years.
According to the testimony of the alleged victim, she was awakened by an intruder in her apartment about 3:00 A.M., March 1, 1975. She was sleeping alone in a bed. The only other occupants of the apartment at the time were her two children of the ages of six and three years, who were sleeping in an adjoining room. She had been recently divorced. She went to bed the evening before at about nine or ten o'clock after she had put the children to bed. She left the window of their bedroom slightly cracked; she went to bed in the nude as was her custom; she was awakened by being poked with a sharp object, which she did not identify at the time but testified that it had the appearance of a letter opener. When she turned over and saw the intruder she observed that he had a handkerchief across the lower part of his face. There was conversation between them as to who else was in the apartment. The man climbed in bed with her and had intercourse with her; she did not resist. She was positive in her identification of defendant;[1] she had never seen him before. Promptly after he left through a door, she locked the doors and closed and locked the windows and checked the children, whom she found asleep. She then went into the bathroom, took a hot bath and went through a feminine cleansing process. She put on her clothes, bundled up her children, got in her car and went to a pay phone booth and called her ex-husband. There was no phone in her apartment. When her ex-husband arrived they took the children to her mother's home; then she and her ex-husband went to the police station and reported the incident to the police.
*743 Defendant did not testify, but members of his family testified to the effect that on the night of the alleged crime he went to bed at a place some four miles from the scene of the crime, approximately an hour prior to its commission, and that he had no means of transportation sufficient to place him there at the time the crime was committed.
Appellant does not contend that the failure of the woman to physically resist precluded a conviction. The rule has been stated time and again to the contrary. We apply here what was said in Rudolph v. State, 275 Ala. 115, 152 So.2d 662:
""The offense of rape is complete when the woman is made to yield through fear. Hooper v. State, 106 Ala. 41, 17 So. 679. The evidence in this case clearly supports a finding that the prosecutrix yielded to her assailant because of fear that her life was in danger. The evidence was not only sufficient to take the case to the jury on the charge of rape, but was amply sufficient to support the verdict of the jury.""
Appellant's counsel, who was appointed to defend him on the trial and to represent him on appeal, in view of his indigency, has ably argued here as he contended there that ""the circumstances of her divorce and... relationship with her former husband, which appeared to be close in view of her calling upon him immediately following the claimed rape"" justified his efforts to explore and bring before the jury ""the possible bad actual character for chastity of the prosecuting witness."" The only cases relied upon by appellant are McQuirk v. State, 84 Ala. 435, 4 So. 775 (1888); Stone v. State, 243 Ala. 605, 11 So.2d 386 (1943); Brown v.

858,0,28189,0,"President Donald Trump proposed extending protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and individuals with Temporary Protected Status in exchange for border wall funding in remarks Saturday afternoon. The proposed deal, however, will likely be dead on arrival due to a lack of support from Democrats.

The President’s latest offer links his demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall to the BRIDGE Act, legislation that would extend protections for so-called “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children and are covered by the DACA program.

The compromise proposal would also allow immigrants covered by Temporary Protected Status — some of whose protections Trump has rescinded — to remain in the country.

The proposal also includes $800 million for urgent humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, as well additional border agents, law enforcement officials and new immigration judge teams to deal with cases of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.

Trump called it a “common sense compromise both parties should embrace” and touted the proposal as “straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense, with lots of compromise.”

While early last year Democratic senators worked on a deal with Republicans which offered $25 billion in border funding in exchange for a permanent path to citizenship for some 1.8 million Dreamers (an offer rejected by the President), the new offer expected to be put on the table by Trump would only extend temporary status, not citizenship, to DACA and TPS recipients.

The lack of a path to citizenship is a nonstarter for Democrats.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Saturday that initial reports of the proposed deal “make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives.”

“It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent",435,11, solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our

Surprise #8 - Plus (+) operator and results of addition

“Adding stuff in JavaScript is simple, obvious and not surprising” - No one ever

Have you ever watched Wat by Gary Bernhardt? If not, I highly encourage you to do it now, it’s absolutely hillarious and concerns a lot of “odd” parts of JavaScript.

Let’s try to explain most of those odd results when using + operator. Beware: once you finishing reading it, you will actually not find most of these results that surprising, it will be just “different”. I’m not sure yet if it’s a good or a bad thing :).

All of these results may seem to be somehow exotic, but only one of them, maybe two at most, are exceptional. The basic thing before figuring out the result of those expressions is understanding what is happening under the hood. In JavaScript you can only add numbers and strings, all other types must be converted to one of thos before. The + operator basically converts each value to primitive (which are: undefined, null, booleans, numbers and strings). This convertion is handled by the internal operation called ToPrimitive which has the following signature: ToPrimitive(input, PreferredType). The PreferredType can be either number or string. The algorithm of this operation is quite simple, here are the steps if string is the preferred type:

return input if it’s already a primitive

If it’s not a primitive, call toString() method on input and return the result if it’s a primitive value

If it’s not a primitive, call valueOf() method on input and return the result if it’s a primitive value

If it’s not a primitive, throw TypeError

For number as preferred type the only difference is the sequence of steps 2 and 3: valueOf method will be called first and if it doesn’t return a primitive then toString method wil be called. In most cases number will be the preferred type, string will be used only when dealing with the instances of Date.

Now that we know what is going on under the hood let’s explain",568,11," the results from the examples above.

How to get a file close event in python

Using python 2.7 on windows 7 64 bit machine.
How to get a file close event:

when file is opened in a new process of file opener (like notepad, wordpad which opens file everytime in new process of wordpad)
when file is opened in a tab of file opener (like notepad++, which opens all files in new tab but there exist only a single process of notepad++ running)

So, how to get file close event in above cases? Is it possible to achieve above cases through  a common code? I am dealing with different file types

A:

This has proven to be a very easy task for *nix systems, but on Windows, getting a file close event is not a simple task. Read below the summary of common methods grouped by OS'es.
For Linux
On Linux, the filesystem changes can be easily monitored, and in great detail. The best tool for this is the kernel feature called inotify, and there is a Python implementation that uses it, called Pynotify.

Pyinotify
Pyinotify is a Python module for monitoring filesystems changes. Pyinotify relies on a Linux Kernel feature (merged in kernel 2.6.13) called inotify, which is an event-driven notifier. Its notifications are exported from kernel space to user space through three system calls. Pyinotify binds these system calls and provides an implementation on top of them offering a generic and abstract way to manipulate those functionalities.
Here you can find the list of the events that can be monitored with Pynotify.
Example usage: 
import pyinotify
class EventHandler(pyinotify.ProcessEvent):
    def process_IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE(self, event):
        print ""File was closed without writing: "" + event.pathname
    def process_IN_CLOSE_WRITE(self, event):
        print ""File was closed with writing: "" + event.pathname

def watch(filename):
    wm = pyinotify.WatchManager()
    mask = pyinotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE | pyinotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE
    wm.add_watch(filename, mask)

    eh = EventHandler()
    notifier = pyinotify.Notifier(wm, eh)
    notifier.loop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    watch('/path/to/file')

For Windows
Situation for Windows is quite a bit more complex than for Linux. Most libraries rely on ReadDirectoryChanges API which is restricted and can't detect finer details like file close event. There are however other methods for detecting such events, so read on to find out more.

Watcher
Note: Watcher has been last updated in February 2011, so its probably safe to skip this one.
Watcher is a low-level C extension for",685,11, receiving file system updates using the ReadDirectoryChangesW API

Of course, people will have concerns about this more hardcore, realistic role-playing with unforgiving consequences. Is it fun? The best answer is to try it for yourself and see. Fallout, Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, Neverwinter Nights 2 and its expansions. Try them. Personally I’ve never had more fun in a video game. The better an RPG is, the more it caters to you. Isn’t that fun and appealing?

I have also seen people claim that action games cannot be RPGs. That argument went along the lines of:

Mass Effect is a cover shooter, not an RPG.

In truth, nothing prevents an RPG from taking any kind of gameplay form. Hence why there are so many different kinds of tabletop RPGs, whether it’s Dungeons & Dragons, Numenera, Cyberpunk, or Vampire: The Masquerade. Nothing in their rulebooks says that video game adaptations must have turn-based or pause-and-play tactical gameplay mechanics. Nope, action gameplay probably makes the most sense for Vampire: The Masquerade. Hence why Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, a video game adaptation, is an action game… and only Fallout 2 clearly has more role-playing than it with regard to video game RPGs.

With that out of the way, let’s summarize everything on the next and final page.

Conclusion

Realistic reactivity, cause and effect, many possible shoes to fill, many different gameplay styles which can take on any form depending on the RPG in question (shooter – Fallout: New Vegas and Mass Effect, action/stealth – Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, turn-based or pause-and-play like so many). Endless replayability. Such quality RPGs were not rare in the past (from around 1997 to 2010, one could probably be found every year), but now we’re on a six year draught. With the booming popularity of not-so-much RPGs like The Witcher 3, the constant downward spiral of Bethesda and BioWare (even if their games aren’t bad games overall), it’s a worrysome situation for RPG fans.

We recently created an RPG tier list. The lack of tier 1-3 RPGs these days, and the fact that tier 1 is occupied by only one game, are both scary. It would only be an improvement for most RPGs to be tier 3 or better. Some more specific, specialized RPGs like Mass Effect are an exception. Personally, these days I have zero excitement for RPGs with less role-playing than the tier 3 games on that list, and even those are a far cry from tiers 1 and 2.

So in this day and age we are left with action adventure video games with a few (often loosely) inspired RPG elements, or indie RPGs that are respectable but still a far cry from the masterpieces we have gotten in the past (ignoring subjectivity, these indie games still don’t have nearly as much role-playing as the games we’ve praised here). They’ve all gotten simpler, more straightforward, more limited. The mainstream AAA RPGs are of course the biggest offenders, as mainstream AAA games are almost always the most dumbed down.

The future does not look good. Obsidian and InXile are still around, they’re some of the only studios who still try. But they have yet to reach the heights they have in the past (indirectly speaking for inXile). Torment: Tides of Numenera has been delayed a thousand times, seeing a different release date each time, which is",824,11," worrysome.

We perceive no illegality as a matter of law in the interpretation so made by the Commission. Therefore, we cannot substitute any interpretation of ours in place of that of the Commission.
Consequently, there is a rational basis for the Commission's finding that Frozen Food is authorized to transport ""frozen eggs and frozen poultry"" from all points in the State of Kansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, and all points in the States of Louisiana and Mississippi. To that extent, the conclusion of the Commission that the supporting shipper to petitioners' application has available ""singleline service for the transportation of frozen eggs and frozen poultry to Memphis and points in Louisiana and Mississippi,"" is invulnerable to attack here, and to that extent the order is sustained by the substantial evidence.

Understanding children's learning

Hi all

I wonder if some of you with a good understanding of the psycological area of teaching elementary school level would give me your views on extra study outside the classroom along with general comments on the information I give.

For background, I teach a class of 30, 10 year olds English for 7 hours average per week. The parents appear highly competitive and also motivated. This is a true foreign language (not ESL) and the kids are all Asian. There are increasing discipline issues and being the only class at the whole school of this nature the kids cannot be mixed and have been together for 3 1/2 years!

I would like to know if extra study is an aid to a class like this for children who are not behind in their learning? I have some children who study 2 hours at the weekend and some who have to attend extra English and non-English learning for anything upto 3 hours per night 5 days a week. Nearly all go to bed at 10 pm or later (cultural issue) and are up at 6 ish. I know the Dept of Education (USA) recommends 10-",295,11,12 hours per night every night for children of this age

875,0,26754,1025," in place. He prepares extensively for public appearances such as this one and filled his remarks with purposeful talking points, speaking with precision — and, at times, in English. Macron went out of his way to avoid conflict with Trump or highlight their differences, despite the U.S. president’s deep unpopularity in France.

Earlier in the afternoon, Trump and first lady Melania Trump met with Macron and his wife at Les Invalides, a historic complex in central Paris that is home to Napoleon Bonaparte’s tomb. As the two couples exchanged pleasantries, Trump sized up Brigitte Macron and commented: “You’re in such good shape.” He then repeated the comment to President Macron, who has proudly filled half his cabinet positions with women and insisted on absolute gender parity for his party’s ticket in France’s recent parliamentary elections.

From there, the two traveled to Elysee Palace to meet one-on-one and then discussed terrorism and other pressing issues with their top aides.

On the campaign trail, Trump promised to “bomb the s—” out of the Islamic State, seize oil from land it controls, kill the relatives of suspected terrorists and bring back waterboarding. In December 2015, Trump proposed temporarily banning all foreign Muslims from entering the United States, and as president, he signed two executive orders that tried to temporarily limit the entrance of people from several predominantly Muslim countries.

Macron was accused of being too soft on terrorism during the French campaign, a charge that has vanished in his first few months as president. He stunned French liberals — many of whom supported him in the election — when he proposed making permanent some portions of French law that grants the government a host of temporary powers during times of crisis to ensure national security.

France has been under an official “state of emergency” since Nov. 14, 2015, the day after a string of Islamic State militants orchestrated a series of deadly attacks on a Paris concert hall and cafes, killing 130. In the 18 months since then, police have been able to conduct warrantless home searches and place individuals under house arrest if they appear “suspicious” in any way.

To the chagrin of civil liberties advocates, Macron has proposed making certain of these powers permanent — albeit with a judicial review component. On Tuesday, more than 200 French academics and researchers condemned the state of emergency in a harshly worded public letter.

While Macron has condemned Trump’s travel ban and comments about Muslims, he has done little since taking office to help migrants displaced by conflicts in the Middle East resettle in his country.

Jacques Toubon, France’s public defender of civil liberties and a former justice minister, likened Macron’s recent proposal to a French Patriot Act, and criticized what he called the law’s “fluid, cloudy” definitions of terrorists and terrorism. “What does it mean, ‘terrorist?’ ” Toubon asked. “What does it mean, ‘terrorism?’ ”

The gray areas, he said, were “dangerous for our national cohesion.”

“There needs to be a debate,” Toubon said of the proposal. “The people, the Parliament, the intellectuals must debate this question — or the question will never come to be debated.”

After giving brief remarks Thursday, Trump and Macron prepared to take four questions from reporters — a rarity for the two leaders who have largely avoided the media.

Cervelli was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to begin the 2012 season, with Chris Stewart winning the job as Martin's backup. Cervelli admitted that he moped following the demotion, until his parents visited him during the season and refocused him on improving his game. The Yankees recalled Cervelli to the majors when rosters expanded on September 1.

When Martin signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cervelli became the starting catcher for the Yankees in 2013. In a game against the Blue Jays on April 26, Cervelli suffered a fractured right hand after getting hit by a foul tip by outfielder Rajai Davis; he then underwent surgery the next day and was placed on the 60-day disabled list. On August 5, 2013, Cervelli was suspended for 50 games after being linked with the Biogenesis scandal.

Cervelli competed with John Ryan Murphy and Austin Romine to be the backup catcher for the Yankees in spring training in 2014. Cervelli won the job, but suffered a hamstring injury on April 13, and was placed on the 60-day disabled list. He returned to the Yankees on June 17. On September 6, Cervelli suffered from cluster migraines. Though they were determined to not be the result of his prior concussions, he missed time while he recuperated. Cervelli finished the 2014 season with a.301 batting average in 49 games.

Pittsburgh Pirates

On November 12, 2014, the Yankees traded Cervelli to the Pirates in exchange for pitcher Justin Wilson. Cervelli started 124 games for the Pirates in 2015, in which he batted.295 and was worth 3.8 Wins Above Replacement. Runners stole a major-league-leading 101 bases against him.

The Intel

To paraphrase what Kevin Bieksa said after Game 3, ""This isn't Champions League. It's not scored on aggregate."" That's a good thing, because they were outscored 12-1 in Boston. But now it doesn't matter if they were outscored by 11 goals, or if they lost both games 2-1 in triple overtime. The series is still tied 2-2.

Fans are panicking and media is salivating because Luongo looks fallible, the power play looks inept and the defense looks confused. Just like in Games 4 and 5 against Chicago. In fact, I'd argue that the Canucks game 4 against Boston was a big improvement. They looked overmatched in the first two periods, but it wasn't grotesque. They stay disciplined, turned away from scrums, and didn't engage in any pissing contests. They got plenty of shots. All good things.

The problem is that they got very few proper scoring chances, especially on the power play. And that is ABSOLUTELY where they need to focus their efforts and energy tonight. A SINGLE power play goal tonight from the Sedins and they are back. They get back their confidence. They get back their feeling that Thomas can be beat. But in order to do that, they have to turn their power play opportunities into SCORING opportunities, something they didn't do in Boston. They let Thomas act like the king of the roost in his crease and they were either too close to him or too far away. They need to stay close to Thomas, but not on top of him. Far enough away to pounce on the rebounds that Thomas gives up. And they need to simplify their power play. They're overthinking, overpassing. It needs to be pass-pass-shoot-rebound.

As for the defense... I REALLLLLLLLLY hope the Bowness is leading his guys on drills on how to get the puck out of their own zone. Their inability to clear pucks effectively just KILLED them in Boston. This is precisely why I hope (and want) AV to switch out Alberts and put Tanev in with Ballard. Tanev plays smart, simple and patient and that is EXACTLY what the Canucks D needs to be tonight. And they need to quit playing the puck along the boards. The Bruins are just waiting for pucks there. Waiting to put the squeeze on the Canucks forwards along the wall. The Canucks D needs to take a breath, Make a pass straight up to a forward, who can take the puck with speed. They need to stop forcing their own forwards to fight for pucks along the boards, before it's even out of the zone. North-South passes.

As for Luongo.. listen - I am not on a Luongo bashing kick. I honestly don't feel that much of what happened in Boston was his fault. In fact, I have Luongo third down the ""blame chart"" - 1. Power Play. 2. Defense. 3. Luongo. Out of twelve goals, he let in two bad ones. And he should have even BEEN in the net for the last 4 goals in Game 3. He SHOULD have been pulled in the second intermission. As long as he gets back to playing his game, and the team in front of them simply DOES their JOB, he'll be fine. He'll be more than fine.

The Canucks have plenty of inspiration and lessons to draw on for tonight's game. This scenario is eerily similar to their series against Chicago. They just need to play with calm. Get back to playing the brand of Canucks hockey that made them so successful throughout the playoffs. Be smart. Be disciplined. Be quick. Be physical. We all know they CAN do it... they just have to put it into action... and also score a goddamn power play goal, for christ's sake. That would really help.

The Three Keys

Here are the three keys for the Vancouver Canucks tonight:

1. The Sedins have to have a GAME. A BIG game. This needs to be their show now.

2. Get the puck out of your own zone. 1-2 passes MAX to get it out. Be patient, but quick.

3. Quit skating arounf Thomas. Stay in front of him, not on top of him. Get",922,11," those rebounds.

Broaching the topic of young voters over breakfast, my nostalgic mum declared that she feels sorry for my generation. “We were whipped into a frenzy by bands like The Clash and The Sex Pistols,” – cue the dreamy-eyes – “We felt that we had a voice, and that what we had to say mattered. These days, you’ve got Ed Sheeran, Adele or Sam Smith droning on about lost love. Very few mainstream musicians get angry about real issues anymore.”

She has a point. And it set me wondering whether perhaps this is what’s needed for us ‘young’ folk to start appreciating our right to vote like we used to – drivers who don’t belong to a party. We’re generally quite cynical of the government and have an interest in political change, but don’t necessarily see voting as the catalyst to this. We’ve not got the roaring and rebellious bands paving the way for reform, spurring the power of the people and encouraging them to speak their mind, vote, and make a difference. We’ve got muppets like Russell Brand harping on about deceit and discouraging all those who look up to him from using the system to let our political preferences be known. Music has a resounding effect on popular trends, fashions and opinions among young people more than any other demographic. Bands like Coldplay and Radiohead are all very middle class and comfortable. Where are all the angry young men and women? A new, passionate, politically driven music movement wouldn’t be great news for the Tories, as the nature of the angry, tormented musical beast is always going to be left of centre.

There were the protest songs of the sixties, the angry punks of the seventies and…then what? Music was a form of resistance against established power, often showing its effectiveness as a force for social change. The U.S. in particular has bred plenty of revolutionary musicians and songwriters penning political messages through story-songs that have enthused interests and changed minds.

Billie Holiday turned executions in the South in to ‘Strange Fruit’ hanging from trees. Aretha Franklin inspired Civil Rights Movements in the 60s by bringing her gospel sounds to protestors in the streets, encouraging everyone to stand up and demand ‘Respect’. More recently, Bruce Springsteen has continually touched on an ever-growing regulated and corporate world, referencing identity struggles and inhibitions for those living within it. Victor Jara created songs about Chile’s struggle with military dictatorships, sparking the Nueva Cancion (New Songs) movement that inspired South Americans to rise up and replace them with democracies.

Pre-millennium Britain had a roster of talent to add to this list. The Clash released ‘White Riot’ aiming to encourage disaffected young white people to riot like their black peers at the time. Their album ‘Sandinista!’ featured an extensive list of songs inspired by political issues outside of Britain; notably, ‘The Call-up’ was a prolific rumination on 1980 US draft policies.

Rock historian Mikal Gilmore recalls a 1977 music festival in Belgium where 20,000 people were separated from their idols by a ten foot-high barbed wire fence. Joe Strummer leapt from the stage in efforts to knock it down. They’d rather run the risk of the audience getting on stage than condone holding them back like caged animals. They were the only artists at the festival who made any noise about the set-up. According to Gilmore, this was their political and social gumption in a nutshell; ‘fighting the good fight that few others would’.

Who will be the next Springsteen, Franklin, or Clash? And why aren’t we hearing their young voices on the radio today? Ultimately, I don’t believe it’s the means by which we vote or the failing campaigns that are the problem.

Is this site for experts, or not?

On the one hand, this question here about what RPG.SE is, and this answer here about answering FATE questions, specify ""[this site] is a collection of expert knowledge"" and ""Expert questions to be answered by Experts"". On the other hand, the help page states

Anybody can ask a question
Anybody can answer

and this answer has several newbie-friendly nuggets of wisdom. This question is encouraging, too.
In the question about FATE, one bit of an answer stated:

It seems like people are so bogged down with non-expert fate questions
that the first instinct is to give an answer suited for a beginner in
the system and not an expert.

This points out that there are non-experts asking questions, that they are many (how are they bogging down people otherwise?), and that they aren't really welcome (at least, not by the answerer): they ask the ""wrong"" sort of questions.
So which is it?
I ask because I'm not an expert on D&D 4E, 2E, Numenera or Fiasco. I just play and GM them. I have very limited time and chances to play, often having dry spells of months between 4-hour sessions. I enjoy rereading my corebooks and splats, but without actual playtime, my questions and answers will never actually be of ""expert level"".
The help page is inclusive, and makes me feel I can actually ask questions here. The first answers and comments cited don't, they make me feel that I can at best lurk and check from time to time if something interesting shows up. In the end, I feel I'm almost restating this question, though not exactly.

Return to FAQ Index

A:

If you play RPGs, you're an expert and welcome.
The line ""Asking Expert questions, getting expert answers"" has a particular history dating to when it was just the original three sites. ""Expert questions"" was important because they didn't want to teach askers the basics of how to program. Being an expert meant that you already knew how to program and what programming meant.
The parallel here isn't perfect, so those words aren't so meaningful here. In practice we're OK fielding a question that is asking to be taught what RPGs are, so long as we don't get too many of them. We're not interested in teaching every comer how to RPG, so mostly we end up closing them as unclear or duplicates of the two or three existing questions about getting started. But we have them.
So what does that say about where we draw",569,11," the line between expert and non-expert?

Popescu et al. (Optics Letters, v. 31, pages 775-777, 2006 (Diffraction phase microscopy for quantifying cell structure and dynamics)) have developed diffraction phase microscopy, which is shown in FIG. 1, as a technique for quantitative phase imaging of biological structures. The method combines the principles of common path interferometry and single-shot phase imaging and is characterized by subnanometer path-length stability and millisecond-scale acquisition time. The potential of the technique for quantifying nanoscale motions in live cells is demonstrated by experiments on red blood cells.
An experimental setup is illustrated in FIG. 1. VPS means a virtual source point, RL is a relay lens, G is a grating, IP is an image plane, L1,2 are lenses (f1,2, respective focal distances), SF means a spatial filter, and CCD is used as a detector.
In this Letter by Popescu et al., they introduce diffraction phase microscopy (DPM) as a novel quantitative phase imaging technique. DPM uses the common path geometry and provides quantitative phase images that are inherently stable to the level of the subnanometer optical path length and at an acquisition speed limited only by the detector.

Rod Millen flips down the visor on his helmet, inches toward the flagman, and sights down the strip of tarmac that leads to the starting line. The road ahead bends right—the first of 156 turns over the next 12.42 miles—and climbs quickly out of sight. The finish line is the 14,110-foot summit of Colorado's Pikes Peak, an unforgiving mountain that's tempted racecar drivers with both glory and disaster for the past 91 years. Millen has won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb nine times, and he set the course record in 1994. His son, Rhys, set another record last year, reaching the summit in a scorching 9 minutes and 46 seconds; Millen thinks he can beat it.

Rod Millen

Race veteran Rod Millen piloted Toyota's EV. ""Right foot on the go pedal, left foot on the brake, no shifting, and no lag in power and torque. You can focus more on what you're doing,"" he says. ""On the other hand, the whole car weighs a lot more than a gas car would.""

He gets the green flag and rolls onto the throttle. For a split-second, Millen feels the rear tires struggle for traction, and then the 563-horsepower vehicle launches toward the first corner, wailing like a one-car police pursuit. Its 120-decibel siren is the only clue that spectators will have of Millen's approach, because this year his racecar, the Toyota TMG EV P002, is almost silent. For the first time in his career, Rod Millen is racing up Pikes Peak in an electric car.

The vehicles engineered to conquer races have historically been the fastest, most powerful, most advanced cars on any road. For decades, racecars served as laboratories where new technology would succeed or fail, and successes often filtered down to production models. But to maintain the suspense of a close competition, modern races, from the circle tracks of the South to the Formula One circuit in Shanghai, now enforce strict rules. And so rather than innovate, engineers have become preoccupied with exploiting tiny loopholes.

As a result, today's production cars are often more advanced than their racing counterparts. A Ferrari 458 Italia offers a traction-control system that's illegal in Fernando Alonso's Ferrari Formula One car, and the Toyota Camry NASCAR racer thundering along the high bank of Daytona can't use the overhead cams and variable valve timing found in every showroom model. No Porsche racer ever built can match the powertrain sophistication of the forthcoming 918 Spyder.

Fortunately, there's one competition where rules haven't stifled innovation. At the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, the speed lab is alive and well, and the most rapid developments are happening in the electric class. Advances in power management, torque vectoring, and even high-speed charging are tested on the mountain and improved upon each year. And, unlike most of the big-money forms of racing, some of what's learned above the Colorado tree line could actually make its way into garages.

Toyota’s TMG EV P002

The fastest electric car at Pikes Peak in 2012. This year, it returned with more power.

Chip Kalback

Until a few years ago, the electric class was little more than a novelty; Joe Ball's Sears electric car took more than half an hour to reach the summit in 1981. But now electrics are legitimate threats to the racecars in the unlimited class, which has no restrictions other than safety. In 2012, Toyota's electric car clocked the fastest overall time on the top section of the mountain, reflecting its twin motors' advantage at high altitude, where the internal-combustion cars lose about 30 percent of their power to the thin air. Most agree that it's only a matter of time before Pikes Peak is ruled by electricity rather than gasoline.

883,0,25472,0,"But it's not just the Iron Man vs. Thor dustup in the forest, or Captain America commanding the super-troops, or the most effective use yet of Hulk onscreen, or Black Widow... 'nuf said... that makes the movie an event. It's what happens when all these combustible elements come together, with the actors already associated with the roles and a bona fide comics nerd at the wheel. Or more than one.

“We have spectacle and special effects that are bigger than anything in some of our other movies combined,” says Marvel Studios president of production Kevin Feige, “but my favorite parts are those character interactions. The scene between (villain) Loki and Widow. The banter and arguments, the ideological conflict between Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Tony Stark (Iron Man).”

“Kevin is a geek,” says appreciative writer-director Joss Whedon, who would know. “He's a big old nerd who really understands comics, really understands movies, and knows the difference.”

Whedon is known for sharp dialogue and character development in the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” TV series, “Firefly” and the hit Internet musical “Dr. Horrible.”

“He's got a pretty good life, that Joss Whedon,” Feige says. “He can do whatever he wants. (The effects are) not what people come out of the movie talking about; they come out talking about those character moments. That's what Joss' stories have; people always talk about the characters. They're hard-core sci-fi, hard-core fantasy. But it's always those moments that play out.”

“Only in the sense of, ‘Whoa, this is tiring,'” Whedon says. “Maybe there's something wrong with me, but it didn't flap me that I was doing this. I feel enormous pressure all the time as a storyteller. I don't feel pressure from budgets and stars. The problems are the exact same problems on any project: ‘We can't get this' or ‘That camera move wasn't as smooth as I hoped.'... For the first three weeks I was literally saying, ‘This is more like directing an Internet musical than I'd imagined.' Everybody's schedules were a nightmare, and the paint was drying on the sets while we were shooting them. That was the only difference — this time we had paint for the sets.”

Evans describes Joss as “another comic-book geek.”

“Joss writes comic books. So any direction he wants to push the character, you never question — Joss knows.”

Evans had his own ice to break in donning the star-spangled uniform — and the six-movie deal that came with it.

“The way movies work is it's a one-at-a-time gig. If you do a movie and it explodes, and you're not coping with it terribly well, you have the opportunity to step back and regroup, get your head on straight,” says the buzz-cut, bearded Evans, looking more life-size than in his bulked-up Cap persona.

“The problem with these movies is, it's such a commitment, a contractual obligation, that if you're struggling with that new life, too bad. You've got to go and make another one. That just scared me. Six movies, they could spread that out over 10 years. I didn't know if I was ready to make a decision for a decade. So I was kind of scared, but I came around.”

Feige says of all the calls he has had to make from his celestial perch atop the Marvel Universe, casting has always been the scariest. He cites the nervous moments when they were “all in,” shooting “Avengers” with Evans and Hemsworth as cornerstone characters before their debut movies, “Captain America: The First Avenger” and “Thor,” had even came out. Luckily, those two films combined for more than $800 million in worldwide gross.

He marvels at how Evans, in particular, has embraced his character.

“His screen persona is so different from Steve Rogers, and so is his own life, frankly. He will talk about what a good",939,11, man Steve Rogers is. Most actors want to talk about

Django, listing the query-set of connected Models

I would like to list all conversations of a User. As seen from picture below, Conversation Model is not Directly connected to the User table. This is a freelancer site project, where users can register as workers to do jobs posted by users.
The result I want is:
my_conversations = User.Conversation.all()

I'm adding this picture, since it paints everything that I will summarise below.
Let's images I have 2 users, one of which is a registered worker. Then it looks as follows:
**Users**
id   Name  ...
1    John
2    Bob

**Worker**
id   user_id  ...
1    2

John posted some job. We add 1 new entry to the JOB table.
**Job**
id    title                          user_id
1     Help me design a database      1

This is a M-to-M relationship (worker can apply for many jobs and one job can have many workers), we define a new table where job_has_worker.
For each job_has_worker, there should be a way to communicate between worker and job poster. 
Now what I would like Django to do is load all conversations the user who is logged in e.g. load a list of my conversations for the jobs I posted.

User = request.user
Jobs = User.job_set.all()

Jobs = User.job_set.all()
for job in Jobs:
    # load conversations
    converstation = job.converstation_set.all()
    # also somehow append this to all conversations

Views - Messages
First I need to get conversation id
Messages = Conversation.get(pk=pk).message_set.get_all()

891,0,22232,0,"When constructing a train station on the edges of a city, you may be blessed by large amounts of open space to work with – such as the huge Crossrail station built inside an old Victorian dock at Canary Wharf.

But building a station in the centre of town is rather more problematic — such as the Crossrail station at Bond Street. Not only do they have very limited space to work in, but all their deliveries have to cope with the local offices and homes…. and there is a complex tube station sitting right next to the building site.

In order to build a large underground station, they have taken over two plots of land and are digging down, then sideways to create a warren of tunnels underneath Bond Street. Yesterday was a chance to have a look.

What is essentially being constructed are two new station entrances at either end of the future Crossrail platforms, with the Western End bolting onto the existing tube station, which itself is getting an upgrade to cope with the extra passengers.

The 3D image below, courtesy of Crossrail shows the site in detail, and the lower-right box is the Eastern entrance, with the upper-left box being another exit and the route to the Jubilee and Central Lines.

Although essentially the same railway station, the two boxes are being constructed in somewhat different ways.

Starting with the Eastern ticket hall – once the previous occupant had been demolished, piles were driven around 50 metres down into the ground around the site to create a “diaphragm wall”, and then due to the nature of the location, they had to install a couple more temporary walls within the site to support the sides as they dig down.

Three shafts were dug down, and then the soil removed around each floor, leaving a visually distinctive profile. This is all temporary though – eventually all of it will be cut away to reveal a large empty box, into which the station will be fitted.

The intention as you can probably see from the above 3D layout is that the station box will take passengers down to a central corridor, and then they take short side passages to the platform tunnels.

While the main tunnel is being dug by a nice big machine, the side passages are still dug by hand. Well, by conventional digging machines used by humans. Then the tunnels are spray lined with concrete to stop them falling down.

And that is what is going on right now.

In fact, if you count from the bottom on that 3D drawing above, it is the 3rd from bottom side tunnel that is being completed right now. And this is what it looks like.

The large arm is remotely controlled by the man in the protective white overalls, while another chap stood behind controlling the machine back end. Other people handle the deliveries of concrete that come down in containers from the surface by crane.

Concrete is not a particularly pleasant material to get onto your skin, so they have to wear all-body overalls, and a special headpiece with its own air filtration supply to stop them breathing in the concrete dust.

We were off to one side and still had to have dust masks and the usual paraphernalia of subterranean building site visits. Emergency rebreather gas masks are on a wall behind, just in case of a gas leak, or similar oxygen sucking event.

Despite the cold wind chilling the bones at the surface, it was almost uncomfortably warm down below with all the machinery blasting out hot air and the concrete dust around.

These side tunnels have to be done by hand though. Machines will probably never replace humans in these tasks, if only because geology is so inconsistent.

Most of the staff doing the spray concrete work are trained in Illford, where Crossrail have built a tunnel training academy, and where your correspondent got to play with the remote concrete spraying arm last year.

It’s not just a case of spray and go though – you do need to be quite careful to spray enough to stop the tunnel collapsing, but not so much that the concrete takes too long to set and become strong.

The Western Ticket hall is a totally different site, and actually, in places not that dissimilar to how the lower half of the Canary Wharf station was built. On a much smaller scale though.

Again, once the previous incumbent was removed from the site, they put a diaphragm wall all around the edges to form the outer wall, within which the station will be dug out.

Here, they are using an underdigging technique, which works really well, even if it means it looks from the outside as it a building site has absolutely nothing going on. Everything is hidden underground.

First a ground floor concrete slab was laid on the site and piles driven down into the ground",998,11, to form what will later be the pillars holding up the

       In its order terminating Appellant’s parental rights, the trial court made the
following relevant findings concerning abandonment by willful failure to visit:

       [Appellant] knew at all times where his son was living, and knew at all
       times that his son was in the custody of [Appellees]. [Appellant] not only
       knew the address, he also knew the [Appellees’] phone numbers.

                                            ***

       [Appellant] also had the knowledge and ability to send letters and /or other
       correspondence to [Appellees] requesting in writing to see his child or to
       spend time with his child. [Appellant] chose not to do so. [Appellant’s]
                                         -5-
      occasional “pop up” visits were both inconsistent and unannounced. Even
      in the light most favorable to [Appellant], he visited, at most, seven times
      for the period from April 2013 through December [7], 2016. Therefore,
      during a period of about 32 months, considering the evidence most
      favorable to [Appellant], he visited the child less than once every four and a
      half months. Furthermore, [Appellant] visited with the child, in the light
      most favorable to his testimony, for a period of no more than an hour to an
      hour and a half. However, the court finds the testimony of [Appellees] to
      be in agreement on this issue that each of [Appellant’s] visits lasted no
      more than 30-45 minutes during each of his visits. Therefore, if he visited
      seven times, he spent a total of less than six hours with his child over more
      than 32 months.

                                           ***

      This action or inaction on the part of [Appellant] was always willful and
      voluntary. He knew at all times where his son was, he made the choice to
      do what he did, and was well aware of his options.... [Appellant] made
      the willful choice to only visit a very limited number of times for a very
      limited period of time. [Appellant] was not prevented by [Appellees] from
      performing his duties as a parent to visit his child.... [Appellant] simply
      chose to have no more relationship with his child than he did. There was
      no climate of hostility between [Appellees] and [Appellant].

                                           ***

Aziz jumps to the fuselage of the Harrier and attacks Harry. After a tense struggle, Harry eventually has Aziz ensnared on the end of one of the plane's missiles, which Harry fires at the terrorist helicopter, killing Aziz and the remnants of his terrorist gang.

A year later, the Tasker's family integrity has been restored, and Helen has become another Omega Sector agent. Harry and Helen embark on a new mission together at a formal party, where they encounter Simon seducing one of the female guests. Helen and Harry intimidate Simon into fleeing, and the film ends with the couple dancing a passionate tango.

Production
Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and ""it went crazy, spinning and rearing"" near a drop of 90 feet. Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and stuntman Billy D. Lucas (who was one of Arnold's main doubles and closest friends) caught him; he concluded, ""[this is] why I will always love stunt people"". Costing $100–120 million to produce, True Lies was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million. It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.

Of the many locations that were used in the film, the Rosecliff Mansion was used for the ballroom tango scenes in the beginning of the film and the exterior of the Swiss chalet that Harry Tasker infiltrates is Ochre Court. The ballroom dancing scene that closes the film, as well as the scenes in the lobby of the fictional Hotel Marquis in Washington, take place in the Crystal Ballroom of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. The outdoor structures used by Azis's smuggling ring as a base of operations were a series of custom made Alaska Structures fabric buildings, leased to the production crew during filming.

Angular Form Reset on Successful Submission

Hoping for someone familiar with Angular to please take a quick look at my syntax.
form.component.html:
(click)=""onSubmit(ruleForm)""
rule.component.ts:
onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
this.dataRulesService.createRuleRequest(this.rule, form, this.newRule);
}

newRule(form: NgForm) {
this.rule = {
  //model is reset
};
form? form.reset() : null;
}

rule.service.ts:
  public createRuleRequest(rule: Rule, form: NgForm, newRule: (form: NgForm) 
=> any) {
//logic
this._postCreateRuleRequest(rule, form, newRule);
}

private _postCreateRuleRequest(rule: Rule, form: NgForm, newRule: (form: 
NgForm) => any) {
this.http.post(`${environment.API_URL}rules/create`, 
 rule).subscribe((response: any) => {
  //success logic
  });
  newRule(form);
 }, () => {
 //failure logic
  });
});
}

I'm trying to reset the form and the rule model on successful submission only (but keep form state on failure). Fairly new to Angular. I tried to pass the NgForm object itself down and pass the newRule function down to the service.
This is working for a ""Clear Form"" button I have on the page - but in much simpler way.
When passing newRule down to rule.service, I get an error: 
vendor.bundle.js:54437 ERROR TypeError: Cannot set property 'rule' of 
undefined
at webpackJsonp../src/app/components/data-rules/data- 
rules.component.ts.DataRulesComponent.newRule

I assume this is a reference to this.rule in the newRule function, which works fine when called from within the rule.component but can't find ""this.rule"" when called from the service.
I should include that rule is being declared publicly:
rule.component.ts:
public rule: Rule;

Any guidance on this syntax would be appreciated.

A few nights ago, I went to bed with a Lyme fever and a sense of foreboding in my gut. I prayed that sleep would cure it, and hoped that I’d wake with renewed energy.

But, it was not to be. Instead, I felt worse — head pounding, body aching, panic rising.

It’s a weekday. I’m on my own. Why, O Lord? I can’t do this today.

Out of bed and shower before the sun is up. Feed the starving crowd. Change the baby. Break up the fighting, dry the toddler’s tears (and my own), rush out the door, and drop the big kids at school.

I held it together as long as I could. Then, in the parking lot, nursing the baby, listening to the 3-year-old beg for more snacks — I had my meltdown.

I love Facebook for many reasons, one of which is that it gives me the ability to communicate throughout the day with my people far and wide, without little ears hearing. And so I took my meltdown to Facebook messenger, and sobbed virtually (while keeping the real tears to a minimum) to a dear friend who lives 10 hours away.

I’m tired, I told her. I’m grieving. I’m struggling. I’m hurting.

Now let me tell you what she said, and what she didn’t, and why it was amazing.

She said, I get it.

She didn’t say, It will get better. It could be worse. God won’t give you more than you can handle.

She said, This life is so, so hard.

And that’s exactly what my heart needed to hear.

There’s something deeply and profoundly healing when pain and suffering are acknowledged for exactly what they are.

Yes, there may be others whose pain is greater than mine. Yes, there could almost always be some other fate that is objectively “worse” than what I am experiencing. Yes, the Lord will most assuredly walk with me, heart to heart and hand in hand, while I carry my cross.

And yet, there is still some pain and sorrow and suffering. They are part of my reality, here and now, for as long as God allows. Pretending that what I feel — physically, emotionally, spiritually, mentally — isn’t real, or isn’t “all that bad,” does nothing to ease my suffering. It only adds to my burden by making me feel guilty for feeling bad in the first place!

There is definitely a time and place for hopeful words and positive outlooks. But I think it’s only after first acknowledging subjective suffering for what it is, without any attempt to diminish it or look at it with rose-colored glasses.

A humble insight came to me as I was praying the rosary recently.

As we meditate on the five mysteries, we enter into both the joys and sorrows of the lives of Christ and His blessed Mother. We embrace all the wonders and glories therein.

And when we look at Our Lord’s passion",699,11,", we never seek to downplay the agonies He"

Newswise — Children delivered by cesarean section and those given antibiotics during early infancy appear more prone to developing allergic inflammation of the esophagus — the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach — according to results of a study by investigators from the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center and Harvard Medical School.

The findings, published online May 2 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, reveal that early antibiotic treatment and C-section delivery may somehow precipitate disease development by altering a child’s microbiota — the trillions of bacteria and other organisms residing in human intestines that regulate digestive health and immunity.

Eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE, is an emerging allergic disease, the causes of which remain unclear. While still relatively rare, EoE appears to be on the rise in both children and adults, research shows. The condition is marked by irritation, inflammation and constriction of the esophagus and by proliferation of eosinophils, or immune cells that multiply during allergic reactions. Because EoE’s cardinal symptoms — heartburn, swallowing difficulties and persistent burping — mimic",251,11," garden-variety gastritis, biopsy of the"

I’m going to try and put to rest all my complaints and whining. I know I’ve said this time and time again, but I think I can do it. Because I’m sick of hearing other people’s complaints and passing the blame on anything. I mean, how many strikes are there currently? Especially the one at Mcgill, I don’t know why there can’t be a more composed way to communicate dissatisfaction. Anyways… let alone all that (quote, unquote — the adult world), I need only to scroll down the Facebook homepage and see so many useless, ungrateful complaints! I know it could be just a slip of mouth, or to get some attention, whatever… but aren’t there better things to announce?

I consider myself to complain a lot and even I find it annoying, but people these days! Yes, I know midterms suck, projects suck, papers suck, school sucks. Life is unfair, but chances are, you’re living the “fair” part of life already. Honestly this is one of the most vibrant times of our lives. We are closing in on our prime, if not already in it, so just seize the day. Everything works out in the end, try your best and relax. I can’t even wait for New Years to make this resolution. I’m just going to stop complaining. So from now on, not a word of negativity from me. If you catch me in it, remind me",360,11," :)

RAD brains have developed using the pattern that evolved for use in good environments while they live and grow in bad environments.

RAD Brains: It Has to do With Your Brain, Not Your Mind.

That sentence caused me to pause as I was recently re-reading one of my favorite books. Let me back up. Over the past year or so, the reading and studying I do to help my family has shifted. I used to read books about Reactive Attachment Disorder, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, etc. Now I read about the brain. In Bessel van der Kolk’s brilliant book, The Body Keeps the Score, he was talking about EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing); a newer therapy used to treat victims of trauma. He related an instance where one of the people who experienced the therapy contacted a family member who specialized in brain studies and told him he needed to study it. “It’s really strange,” she said. “It has to do with your brain, not your mind.” That’s where I want to go with today’s discussion about RAD brains.

RAD brains have developed using the pattern that evolved for use in good environments while they live and grow in bad environments. The construction can be no better than the materials and that is where RAD brains struggle.

I have a bad habit of using the words mind and brain interchangeably. Of course we know that isn’t correct. The mind is our personality. It is who we are. It is our “self.” As a Christian, I might call it my spirit or soul. It is who I am with or without the substance that makes up my body, or any part thereof. Of course a person’s mind, or, “self” plays a huge roll in who we are, but sometimes we run into trouble with the organ that processes what our mind creates and retains. I mean, blood is a great thing and it keeps our bodies going if, and only if, our hearts are delivering our blood in the way that they should. If the organ that handles the blood is malfunctioning or not functioning, our bodies experience the problems that a lack of fresh blood cause. It’s the same with minds that are served by RAD brains. I want to be very clear, here. I don’t believe in RAD minds, only RAD brains. There is nothing malfunctioning with the victim’s mind. Their mind, their self, is not bad. It might be hurt, but its feelings are not wrong. RAD brains have developed using the pattern that evolved for use in good environments while they live and grow in bad environments. The construction can be no better than the materials and that is where RAD brains struggle.

RAD brains also copy what they see. When most of what they experience is anger and violence, most of the templates they create are negative, rather than the positive ones that are created by children who grow up in healthy environments.

In addition to self-monitoring daily mood charts, as described in Case 1, medication dosing was checked, and wake-up time, bedtime, medication time, and body weight were recorded. Her mood fluctuations decreased, and her mental state has remained relatively stable for more than 5 years. For work, she helped her parents at an apple farm. She has continued the self-monitoring daily mood charts for more than 6 years, and her mental state has remained stable ([Table 1](#t1-ndt-13-733){ref-type=""table""}). She visits us at a 2-week interval.

Case 3
------

The patient was a 54-year-old Japanese female with a 3-year history of type II bipolar disorder with two admissions for a depressive state. She was treated with 800 mg/d of lithium and 0.25 mg/d of brotizolam. Because her mood swings were becoming too rapid, self-monitoring daily mood charts as described in Case 1 was initiated. In addition to self-monitoring daily mood charts, wake-up time, bedtime, and medication checks were recorded. Her mood fluctuations decreased, and her mental state has remained stable for more than 5 years. She got married 2 years after initiating self-monitoring daily mood charts, and she does housework. She has continued the self-monitoring daily mood charts for more than 5 years, and her mental state has remained stable ([Table 1](#t1-ndt-13-733){ref-type=""table""}). She visits us at a 4-week interval.

Discussion
==========

The results of cases suggested that our paper-and-pencil form of self-monitoring daily moods was effective for preventing recurrence for bipolar disorders. We have maintained a stable mental condition for over 5 years using self-monitoring of daily mood in three cases, all of whom had a high risk of recurrence, although this number of subjects was very small and observation period was still short. We calculated the mean and coefficient of variation using 365 points ([Table 1](#t1-ndt-13-733){ref-type=""table""}). Mood fluctuations decreased in all patients as the average score approached zero and coefficient of variation values decreased over time. As long-term treatment should be required for patients with bipolar disorder, our method of self-monitoring daily mood may be superior to current options",520,11, in terms of utility and feasibility. Further studies are required

913,0,22908,0,"OnePlus to open Indian R&D centre soon

Indian market is the biggest revenue generator for OnePlus

OnePlus will soon be opening an R&D centre in India in line with its commitment to make India its second global headquarters by the year end. The company is looking at locations in Hydrabad, Bangalore and Chennai.

OnePlus already has a small R&D team of around five people in Bangalore centre. The new facility is expected go live by the end of this quarter. Around 10–20 percent of OnePlus’ global R&D team will be present in India. OnePlus’ R&D work in India will focus on understanding user requirements in the country, seeking partnerships with key app players in India like Paytm, testing on an ongoing basis and working closely with telecom carrier partners. Around 25–50 people are expected to be part of the new R&D team.

In 2017, OnePlus registered a revenue of over $ 1.4 billion globally, which is nearly twice its 2016 revenue. More than a third of this revenue came from India (more than $ 460 million), making it OnePlus’ largest market worldwide. One Plus is the only Chinese smartphone maker, two-thirds of whose revenue comes from outside China.

OnePlus currently employs 85 people in India. By the end of the year this number is expected to increase to 100–120 people.

Vikas Agarwal, General Manager, OnePlus India

The company managed to sell one million units of its latest flagship model — OnePlus 6 — in three weeks. Last year it took three months to reach this number. In 2014, the company sold just over a million of its first flagship phone that year.

According to the recently released Counterpoint Market Monitor Service Data Q2 2018, OnePlus has emerged as the leader in the premium smartphone segment in India. OnePlus 6 was the best-selling model in premium segment making it the leader for the full quarter (April, May, June 2018) surpassing Samsung and Apple. OnePlus was also the fastest growing smartphone brand annually, growing at 284%. In the first quarter of 2018 OnePlus had a market share of around 25 % in India, trailing behind Samsung.

Premium phones constitute less than 4 percent of the market in India. In other global markets it is 50–60 percent of the over all market.

Amazon was its first partner in the Indian market. Now OnePlus is taking this partnership model to Germany and elsewhere. The latest 6-series flagship model from OnePlus has become its most popular phone ever on JD, an e-commerce company headquartered in Beijing. OnePlus has also entered into a carrier-partnership with Elisa Oyj, a Finnish telecommunications company. “We have decided that focus should be on core products and for everything else we are going to have partners,” said Vikas Agarwal, General Manager, OnePlus India.

With around 800 people employed globally OnePlus is able to avoid HR overheads and maintain its lean framework. As a company that likes to outsource and delegate functions, OnePlus’ focus is on designing the core product.

The company launched its Make in India program with the OnePlus X in October 2015. Currently, the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and several other components of the the OnePlus 6 are made in India by the company’s primary contract manufacturer — Oppo in Noida. Oppo is OnePlus’ global manufacturing partner and carries on in India the same partnership arrangement it has in China.

OnePlus was founded in December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei. According to reports, Oppo Electronics (not Oppo Mobile) is the only institutional stockholder in OnePlus.

In the second half of 2018, OnePlus is set to open over 10 new offline touchpoints in 10 key markets. The company recently opened offline stores in Bangalore, Mumbai and Kolkata on 28th July, 2018. The stores have opened in Jayanagar, 4th Block in Bangalore, Central Mall in Mumbai and South City Mall in Kolkata. By 2019 it is expected to have 14 offline touch points.

By end of this year the company expects to have 25 service centres and 6 experience centers in the country. Its experience centre in Chennai is expected to come up by next month. Over the next two weeks the service centre in its first experience centre in Bangalore will be expanded from the basement to the first floor.

“With India becoming the second headquarters for OnePlus, we are looking to increase our focus on offline to reach out to the large majority of the Indian market that prefer tangible stores for experience before purchase. However, we will continue to be",962,11," a digital-first brand,” said Vikas"
914,0,26482,0,"(BIVN) – Shan Tsutsui announced that he will be resigning as Lieutenant Governor, and will be returning to Maui where he will join a communications and research firm.

Tsutsui said his resignation is effective January 31, 2018.

Tsutsui will now serve as a Senior Vice-President for Strategies 360, described in a media release as a public affairs, strategic communications and research firm with offices in Hawaii, 11 other Western states and Washington D.C.

The outgoing Lieutenant Governor had this statement:

“With a grateful, yet heavy heart I am announcing today that I will be resigning as the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Hawaii, effective January 31, 2018. Over the past 15 years, it has been my honor and privilege to have served the people of Hawaii, first as a State Senator from Maui and Senate President, and currently as your Lieutenant Governor. Throughout that time, I have always been mindful of the tremendous responsibility that comes with public office. I have greatly appreciated the trust and confidence that was bestowed upon me and have done my best to build a better Hawaii through collaboration and hard work, while honoring our shared core values of honesty, integrity and respect.

As Senate President, I was fortunate to draw upon my many years in the Senate and the relationships that I had established to exhibit a collaborative style of leadership, and I did my best to ensure that all Senators were respected and heard. As your Lieutenant Governor, I have continued to work cooperatively with leaders in the public and private sectors, as well as members of the public, with that same level of respect and attention. During this time, I am proud to have established the Resources for Enrichment, Athletics, Culture and Health (R.E.A.C.H.) initiative to support after-school programs for middle and intermediate public school students. As a father, I was especially concerned with ensuring that middle school students engage in positive activities and relationships during hours when many are left unsupervised because their parents are working. Since 2013, R.E.A.C.H. has invested approximately $2.75M in more than 40 public middle and intermediate schools, including charter schools, statewide, reaching thousands of students. Funds have helped to provide robotics programs; hula, ukulele, music and other dance lessons; basketball, soccer, wrestling and other sports; cooking, fishing, art, and hydroponics; and many other clubs and programs. Participating students have shown improved attendance, attitude, behavior and even grades.

Additionally, I was excited to have taken the reigns of the Farm to School Initiative, which we have developed into the “‘Aina Pono: Hawai‘i’s Farm to Cafeteria Initiative,” to increase the purchase and consumption of local food in our school cafeterias. With an enthusiastic team of advisors and ‘doers,’ along with support from the Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, private partners such as The Kohala Center, and many other generous donors, a burgeoning pilot project was launched to infuse local foods and flavors into our school menus, while providing healthier options for our keiki. As the project continues to grow and expand throughout the State, the effects will have a lasting impact on our keiki, the agriculture industry, and the state’s procurement processes.",696,11,"

ROCKFORD — Chief Judge Joseph McGraw found Sheila and Marissa Brown in criminal contempt of court today and fined them $500 each for disregarding his order in December 2009 to testify to a Winnebago County grand jury.

Sheila Brown and her daughter, Marissa, then 17, were witnesses in August 2009 to the fatal shooting of Mark Anthony Barmore during an altercation with police. They were given less than a week’s notice of their scheduled grand jury testimony two days before Christmas.

“They knew what they had to do and when they had to do it,” McGraw said as he rendered his verdict. “Mrs. Brown and Ms. Brown knew what was required and did not obey.”

McGraw said he would have sentenced the Browns to jail if Sheila Brown had not testified that they had been following the poor advice of their lawyer, Sam Adam Jr.

With long-standing plans to visit family and participate in religious services in Mississippi for Christmas, the Browns asked McGraw to grant them a continuance until after the trip.

McGraw said it was a tough call but ruled that the trip was not urgent and did not trump their duty and the community interest to testify as scheduled Dec. 23, 2009.

He denied their request for a continuance.

Sheila Brown testified that Adam advised her that his appeal of McGraw’s decision would circumvent McGraw’s jurisdiction. Brown testified she was advised the appeal would allow them to go on the planned trip and repeatedly asked Adam if he was sure about it.

“I didn’t want to do anything wrong,” Brown said. “If the judge wanted me here",455,11,", I wanted to be here.”

Sink particles are often introduced in hydrodynamical simulations to deal with gravitational collapse of a part of the system that can no longer be resolved [e.g., @Bate95].

Dust particles that are within $r_{\rm sink}$ and gravitationally bound to the sink are accreted.

922,0,26850,2050," complete thrombosis of the right coronary artery turned bluish.

The patient had scheduled a follow-up three months after discharge. The CTA demonstrated that the RCA was totally occluded, except a small caliber true lumen visualized ([Figure 3](#f3){ref-type=""fig""}).

Fig. 3A follow-up CTA demonstrating that the right coronary artery was undeveloped and only a short period of residual cavity remained.

DISCUSSION
==========

A coronary involvement in type A aortic dissection is a serious phenomenon in clinic, which presents in 10-15% patients with aortic dissection^\[[@r2]\]^. Clinical research has shown that the mortality rate of a type A aortic dissection involving the coronary artery is high (up to 20% \~ 33.3%) after surgery^\[[@r3],[@r4]\]^. According to Neri et al.^\[[@r5]\]^, there are three mechanisms of total occlusion of right coronary ostium: type A, where ostial dissection is defined as a disruption of the inner layer limited to the area of the coronary ostium; type B, a dissection extending into the coronary artery; and type C, a coronary disruption (intimal detachment). The ideal treatment for this condition is surgery with ascending aorta replacement and CABG or a coronary repair, if possible. In our patient, acute Type A aortic dissection was accompanied with myocardial infarction and pericardial effusion. Without prompt treatment, it will result in death due to myocardial infarction or aortic rupture. The RCA dissection was already suspected based on the presence of pathologic Q on ECG on the patient's arrival. But in the surgery, we found RCA was bluish from the trunk to branches, and the RCA was totally thrombosed. The true lumen couldn't be found when we opened the RCA. There was no place available for CABG on the RCA. The follow-up CTA also demonstrated that the RCA was totally occluded, except for a small caliber true lumen visualized. After a regular surgery of Stanford type A aortic dissection, the patient was difficult to wean from CPB due to the right heart dysfunction. In this case, we excluded consideration of an intra-aortic balloon pump because of the residual dissected thoracoabdominal aorta. The only option left was to continue to use assisted circulation which helped myocardial recovery. The right ventricular circulatory support was another option, but was not approved for use in China. Besides, we had more experience on installing ECMO on patients with right ventricular failure and got satisfied outcomes. So, we chose ECMO to assist right heart function. As expected, the hemodynamic parameters were favorable after initiation of ECMO, and the right ventricular wall motion was gradually improved during the post-operation period.

This is the first report of using ECMO to successfully treat a complete occlusion of the RCA, when CABG can't be performed due to a Stanford Type A aortic dissection. This case demonstrates the value of ECMO in assisting right heart function to ensure stable hemodynamics and myocardial recovery in the type A aortic dissection with coronary involvement.

HIV superinfection (also called HIV reinfection) is a condition in which a person with an established human immunodeficiency virus infection acquires a second strain of HIV, often of a different subtype. These can form a recombinant strain that co-exists with the strain from the initial infection, as well as the strain from the new virus, and may cause more rapid disease progression or carry multiple resistances to certain HIV medications.

HIV superinfection may be interclade, where the second infecting virus is phylogenetically distinct from the initial virus, or intraclade, where the two strains are monophyletic.

People with HIV risk superinfection by the same actions that would place a non-infected person at risk of acquiring HIV. These include sharing needles and forgoing condoms with HIV-positive sexual partners. Cases have been reported globally and studies have shown the incidence rate to be 0-7.7% per year. Research from Uganda published in 2012 indicates that HIV superinfection among HIV-infected individuals within a general population remains unknown. Further research from The Journal of Infectious Diseases indicates that there have been 16 documented cases of superinfection since 2002.

926,0,24817,0,"(CNN) Prosecutors in Los Angeles charged Harvey Weinstein on Monday with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013.

Weinstein faces new felony charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

""We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,"" Lacey said.

The charges came hours after Weinstein appeared in a New York court for the start of his criminal trial on similar charges in a separate case.

According to the criminal complaint, Weinstein and a woman attended a Hollywood film festival on February 17, 2013, and later that night, he knocked on her hotel room door and was allowed entry into her room. Once inside, they talked briefly before he allegedly attacked the woman, forced her to perform oral sex on him, digitally penetrated her vagina and raped her, the complaint says.

She said that she did not disclose the assault because he threatened her life if she spoke, the complaint says. The charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation and sexual penetration by use relate to that incident.

On February 19, Weinstein met with a woman and her acquaintance for a business meeting at a hotel eatery in West Los Angeles, the complaint says. Weinstein persuaded the two to accompany him to his hotel suite, and one woman unwittingly followed him into the bathroom, the complaint says.

He allegedly took off his clothes and prevented her from leaving, and then he held her in place by her breast as he masturbated, the complaint says. He faces a charge of felony sexual battery by restraint for that incident, Lacey said.

Weinstein has denied all allegations of ""nonconsensual sexual activity"" related to the New York case and other claims made against him. In an earlier interview, Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunna said any new charges would be ""highly prejudicial"" to a jury in the New York case.

Once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers and gatekeepers, Weinstein's career collapsed in October 2017 after The New York Times and The New Yorker published stories detailing numerous accusations of sexual harassment and assault against him.

Since then more than 80 women have come forward with similar stories of Weinstein using his power and influence to take advantage of young female assistants and actresses over several decades. The reporting, which garnered the two outlets the Pulitzer Prize, also showed how Weinstein used his powerful team of attorneys and media allies to pressure the women into staying silent.

Victims first reported attacks in 2017

In the LA case, the two victims reported these incidents to police in 2017, and they were presented to the district attorney's office for criminal charges later that year. Lacey said that the charges were announced today, years later, because of the challenge of the specific cases.

""It was very challenging to get those victims to open up and tell us what they needed to tell us. For some of them it was embarrassing, it was terrifying, and so until then we were just working to see if we could get the evidence needed to get to court,"" she said.

Neither of the two women have previously come forward with their allegations, and one is expected to testify in the New York case, prosecutors said.

That the charges were announced the same day as the start of his New York trial was just a coincidence, Lacey said. Prosecutors are asking for his bail to be set at $5 million.

Lacey said she did not want to interfere with the New York case and that the judge will have to decide whether he can remain out on bail given the new charges.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office had previously said that eight women had come forward against Weinstein. Lacey said that three of those cases were outside of the statute of limitation, two led to today's charges and three others are still under investigation.

The case against Weinstein is the first criminal case to be filed by the task force Lacey created in 2017 in response to allegations in the entertainment industry, she said. Her office investigated more than 40 cases and most were declined because they fell outside the statue of limitations or evidence was insufficient.

Weinstein's New York trial began today

Weinstein, 67, arrived to court in Manhattan using a walker on Monday to begin his trial for allegedly raping a woman in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another in 2006.

He faces five felony charges based on the claims by two women, one of whom remains anonymous. Several other women who say",962,11," he assaulted them will also testify, including ""The Sop"

It’s symbolic that Alaska Airlines—and now Delta—offer nonstop service to SEA-TAC from Indianapolis. But to get anywhere near comparable traveler numbers would create quite a strain. Consider these 2016 numbers:

SEA-TAC moved 46 million people—No. 9 nationally and No. 28 in the world.

IND moved 8.5 million people—No. 49 nationally and No. 217 in the world.

SEA-TAC represents far more than simply traffic to and from Amazon and Microsoft, of course. It’s a major gateway to Asia, Alaska, and the Pacific. So we don’t need to be 1:1 with SEA-TAC in terms of full capabilities and throughput. But we’ll need to grow.

The worst-case scenarios like Motorola are rare, and right now, the airport is more than adequate. Those two things make Bryan Robbins happy. Currently the Executive Director of the Economic Development Corporation Greensburg/Decatur County, Robbins was on the steering committee that helped author Greensburg’s comprehensive city development plan more than 10 years ago. This task included helping assemble and implement the plan that ultimately attracted Honda Manufacturing to Greensburg—resulting in a plant that now employs more than 2,400 workers from 31 different counties in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.

With 10 years in the rearview mirror since the first Honda Civic came to a celebrated pause at the end of the Greensburg line, Robbins has earned his merit badge of perspicacity about what makes a successful relationship between a corporation and the community it calls home.

It turns out it’s a lot of work, it’s best to be honest with each other from the very beginning, and aging happily together takes patience and communication.

“It’s a marriage,” he says very plainly, “and the sooner the partners realize that the other isn’t perfect, nor will they ever be, the quicker and more effective the cooperation will be.”

Construction of the Honda plant required—and continues to require—expert planning in logistics, utilities, and transportation. Problems are rare, but the important thing is to anticipate and plan for them, not to hope they don’t surface. Transportation is one example. “It takes a while to get the traffic infrastructure right,” Robbins says, adding, “And that’s not a knock on our engineers. You don’t specifically know how the travel patterns will be until they get going.” He says there will always be backups, trains, and challenging intersections, but having a plan to figure them out is part of the relationship he’s helped build between the public and private sector.

“Amazon might be the new, attractive partner in the room, but those other partners have been with you through thick and thin and shouldn’t be neglected. They helped you get where you are.”

In some ways, Robbins says, the infrastructure problems are the best kind of problems, because “you have specific experts in that realm with knowledge of what both business and community bring to the table and what they need.”

930,0,24861,0,"Five Key Phrases for Health Advocates

by julie on April 30, 2014

Living with a chronic or invisible illness like narcolepsy can be confusing and overwhelming. Here are the key phrases that have helped me survive and thrive in critical moments when I needed to advocate for myself and my health. I suggest adding these phrases to your vocabulary asap.

#5. “Is there someone else I can speak with?”I used to be agreeable and trusting on the phone, til I got caught in a few snafoo catch-22s with my health insurance and realized that (some) customer service representatives say stuff with authority that is blatantly incorrect. Meanwhile, my health is on the line and they could care less. Now, I advocate for myself – I listen respectfully but if anything doesn’t sit right with me, I kindly ask to speak to someone else – aka a manager. I used to think this was rude, but now I realize it’s quite standard. Keep going, keep holding, keep calling back.

#4. “I haven’t heard that joke…. TODAY.” I used to think that narcolepsy was the only illness that got made fun of so much, but in meeting various health advocates, I’ve learned that unwelcome humorous reactions to diseases and disorders are all too common. Even though I confidently speak about narcolepsy in many forums, I am not immune to the silly jokes.

Just last week, someone at work overheard that I was giving a presentation at USC on narcolepsy, and he felt compelled to join the conversation to laugh and add a joke about falling asleep. Good one, buddy. I try to brush it off, it’s a small price to pay for raising so much awareness that evening at USC. When I told my boyfriend later, he shared a great come-back he’s used in his life: “I haven’t heard that joke… TODAY.” I can’t wait to try it! I like to view every conversation as a chance to raise awareness, and I’ll follow up explaining “Actually, narcolepsy is nothing like the movies, its a really fascinating neurological disorder.”

#3. “Can I ask a favor?”I am an independent woman, I like to think I can do everything for myself. But in reality, my friends and family help me in different ways and I’m VERY thankful. (Read here about creating a strong support system.) It’s hard to ask for “help”, but what about asking for a favor? You likely do favors for your friends and family as well. It’s",575,11," okay to lean on others sometimes, we all lean on"

### Flow cytometry analysis {#sec3-6}

Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were collected and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using an annexin V FITC apoptosis detection kit I (BD biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer\'s instructions. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry using a BD FACSVerse system.

### Tumor xenograft model in nude mice and shRNA treatment {#sec3-7}

Lentivirus-mediated PGAM1 knockdown in PC-3 cells was achieved using a lentivirus kit according to the manufacturer\'s instruction (GeneCopoeia, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, the cells were infected with a lentivirus bearing short hairpin (sh) RNA targeting PGAM1[@ref12] (5′-CCGGCAAGAACTTGA AGCCTATCAACTCGAGTT GATAGCTTCAAGTTCTTGTTTTTTG-3′) and a recombinant hnRNP-L lentivirus. The NC groups were infected with the empty lentiviral vector. The infection efficiency was validated by Western blotting analyses.

Female athymic mice (BALB/c-nu/nu; 4--5 weeks old) were purchased from the Animal Center of Southern Medical University and were housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions and bred in accordance with the institutional guidelines. To evaluate PCa tumor growth *in vivo*, 5 × 10^6^ PC-3 cells stably expressing PGAM1 shRNA via lentiviral infection or NC cells were injected subcutaneously and bilaterally into the flanks of athymic mice (6 mice per group). Tumor dimensions were measured on two perpendicular axes and tumor volume was calculated with the formula: volume = (length × width^2^)/2. The mice were euthanized by CO~2~ inhalation after 25 days and the tumors were removed and weighed, then the primary tumors were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and observed under a microscope. All of the procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Southern Medical University.

### Statistical analysis {#sec3-8}

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. The Student\'s *t*-test was used to analyze continuous data, the Chi-square test was used for categorical data, and factorial analysis of variance was used to analyze differences between groups. *P* \< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Steve, great choice. When my kids were younger I used them as an excuse to watch Recess.

SQUARE PEGS and THE PAPER CHASE come to mind as favorites when I was young.

I really like the handful of episodes I have seen of COMMUNITY. That show's humor would be right up my alley, but I have generally stayed away from shows set in schools because I work at a school - it's not a setting I want to visit when watching TV!

Way back in 1989, when people like me were more focused on the joys of American college privilege — smoking pot, making art, hanging out at the river, uh, I guess maybe learning some stuff — in an area of the world we weren’t paying much attention to, Cuba faced a crisis called the “Special Period.”

The Special Period was when the Soviet Union collapsed and the island country of Cuba, part of the former’s Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or COMECON, lost half or more of its oil supply essentially overnight.

So what’s in a name? Why the “Special Period?” The question is, Was it really that special?

The Special Period was either actually special or…especially cray cray! You be the judge:

Lights Out

When any society, like, for example, OURS, is utterly dependent on a few precious resources, say, uh, oil, the precipitous withdrawal of that resource kinda, well, spells major disaster. Fast like.

Such was the case in Cuba during the Special Period. And it could’ve gotten ugly. Strange thing is that during the Special Period…it didn’t. Get ugly, that is.

I mean, I’m not saying there was NO pain when all the oil dried up and Cuba was left all on its lonesome to fend for itself. It’s not like the US was willing to help.

Plenty of pain among the Cuban people was catalogued by researchers and historians alike. Food shortages, while not leading to starvation, did rack the population as it adjusted downward. This was felt especially hard among the sick, young children, and the elderly.

But the amazing and unexpected thing was that The Special Period for Cuba actually prompted a kind of renaissance in the wake of this instantaneous resource disruption, the result of which may be part of what we’re seeing in renewed efforts at opening Cuban-American relations some three decades later. It’s not a direct line, but clearly the Special Period marked when definitive change was injected into the Cuban trajectory.

============

Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death worldwide ([@BIO041913C4]). The atherosclerotic lesion is characterized by the development of fibroinflammatory lipid plaques in the inner lining of arteries ([@BIO041913C33]). This involves the directed migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from the medial to the intimal layer of the vessel wall, where they undergo proliferation and synthesize extracellular matrix to form a fibrous cap that covers the atherosclerotic plaque ([@BIO041913C20]). VSMCs are also the predominant cell type found in the lesions during restenosis after angioplasty, stenting and in vein graft disease, where they migrate and proliferate to form the thickened neointima ([@BIO041913C8]). It is well established that soluble growth factors regulate VSMC proliferation and migration ([@BIO041913C22]). Moreover, within the vessel wall, VSMCs make adhesive contacts with neighbouring cells as well as the extracellular matrix. The dynamic remodelling of cell--cell and cell--matrix contacts can regulate cellular and molecular processes in VSMCs to coordinate cell behaviours such as proliferation and migration ([@BIO041913C11]; [@BIO041913C18]; [@BIO041913C22]).

Balloon denudation of the endothelium is a model of mechanical injury to the artery that triggers the directional migration of VSMCs to form a thickened neointimal layer ([@BIO041913C8]). Following mechanical injury of the carotid artery in the rat, our lab showed elevated expression of both discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) ([@BIO041913C13]) and N-cadherin in VSMCs ([@BIO041913C19]). DDR1 is a collagen-binding receptor tyrosine kinase, and its deletion reduces VSMC migration towards collagen *in vitro* and attenuates neointimal thickening and atherosclerotic plaque formation *in vivo* ([@BIO041913C10]; [@BIO041913C13]). Recent research has shown that DDR1 can stabilize cadherin-containing contacts, but many studies have focused on the effects of DDR1 in stabilizing E-cadherin contacts in epithelial cells ([@BIO041913C7]; [@BIO041913C9]; [@BIO041913C34]). Furthermore, these effects were found to be context-dependent. In normal epithelial cells, DDR1 forms a complex with E-cadherin, stabilizing cell--cell adhesions ([@BIO041913C9]; [@BIO041913C34]). By contrast, in cancer, DDR1 is upregulated and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing the expression of N-cadherin, promoting cell migration and invasion ([@BIO041913C2]; [@BIO041913C16]; [@BIO041913C25]; [@BIO041913C30]). Clearly, the effects of DDR1 on cadherin-based contacts cannot be extrapolated between different cell types and conditions. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no research studying the effects of DDR1 on N-cadherin cell--cell contacts in VSMCs.

VSMCs express several types of cadherin molecules, including N-cadherin, T-cadherin, R-cadherin, FAT1-cadherin and OB-cadherin ([@BIO041913C26]; [@BIO041913C33]). OB-cadherin promotes cell--cell adhesion and collectivization of VSMCs ([@BIO041913C3]). T-cadherin ([@BIO041913C17]) stimulates proliferation and induces migration of VSMCs, potentially contributing to intimal hyperplasia in atherosclerotic lesions and vessel stenosis. FAT1- ([@BIO041913C14]) and R-cadherin ([@BIO041913C31]) may have an antiproliferative function through the sequestration of",935,11," β-catenin, preventing its translocation to"

This invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus arranged to process, record and/or reproduce images and sounds.
2. Description of the Related Art
FIG. 8 shows in a block diagram a conventional digital electronic camera. Referring to FIG. 8, the digital electronic camera 800 is arranged to use a memory card 801 as a recording medium. The camera 800 includes a photo-taking lens 1, a diaphragm shutter 2 which is a shutter, but functions as a diaphragm as well, and a flash device 3. A CPU 4 is arranged to control mechanical and operation parts. A driving circuit 5 is arranged to drive each part of a mechanical system. An image sensor 6 is arranged to convert into an electrical signal a reflection light which comes from an object of shooting. A timing signal generating circuit (abbreviated to a TG circuit) 7 is arranged to generate a timing signal necessary for operating the image sensor 6. An image sensor driving circuit 8 is arranged to amplify the timing signal from the timing signal generating circuit 7 up to a level necessary for driving the image sensor 6. A preprocessing circuit 9 is provided with a CDS circuit for removing a noise from the output of the image sensor 6 and a nonlinear type amplifying circuit for amplifying the output of the image sensor 6 prior to an A/D (analog-to-digital) conversion process. Reference numeral 10 denotes an A/D converter and reference numeral 12 a buffer memory. A signal processing system control CPU 13 is arranged to control each part of a signal processing system. An operation display part 14 is arranged to make a display in aid of operation by showing the state of the camera. An externally-accessible operation part 15 is provided for operating the camera. A memory controller 802 is arranged to control the buffer memory 12. A digital signal processing circuit 803 is arranged to make the output of the image sensor 6 into a form suited for recording on the memory card 801. A memory card interface (I/F) 804 is arranged to connect the digital electronic camera 800 to the memory card 801. The conventional digital electronic camera 800 operates as described below with reference to FIG. 8.
With the operation part 15 operated by a camera operator, the digital electronic camera 800 enters into a state of performing a shooting action. The photo-taking lens 1 is controlled by the mechanical and operation part control CPU 4 and the mechanical system driving circuit 5 in accordance with the intention of the operator. At this time, the conditions of shooting, etc., are displayed at the display part 14 to inform the operator of the state of the camera 800. The luminance of the object of shooting is measured by a light measuring circuit which is not shown. An aperture value and a shutter speed of the diaphragm shutter 2 are then derived from the mechanical and operation part control CPU 4. The mechanical system driving circuit 5 drives the diaphragm shutter 2 on the basis of the control values thus derived from the CPU 4. Depending on the output of the light measuring circuit, a shot may be taken by flashing the flash device 3. When an exposure is effected in this manner, a reflection light from the object of shooting comes to fall upon the image sensor 6 via the photo-taking lens 1 and the diaphragm shutter 2. The diaphragm shutter 2 then acts to limit the quantity of the incident light upon the image sensor 6. If the image sensor 6 is an interlaced reading type CCD, the diaphragm shutter 2 is arranged to prevent an electric charge signal from being affected by the incident light. The image sensor 6 is arranged to be operated by a driving signal which is outputted from the TG circuit 7 and is amplified by the image sensor driving circuit 8. The action of the TG circuit 7 is controlled by the signal processing system control CPU 13. The output of the image sensor 6 which is driven in this manner is supplied to the preprocessing circuit 9. Upon receipt of the output of the image sensor 6, the preprocessing circuit 9 performs a CDS (correlated double sampling) process to remove a low band noise from the output of the image sensor 6 (or a pickup image signal) and a process of making the pickup image signal into a nonlinear state for the effective use of the dynamic range of the A/D converter 10. The pickup image signal thus preprocessed is converted into a digital signal by the A/D converter 10. The digital signal thus obtained is inputted to the memory controller 802. Under the control of the signal processing system control CPU 13, the memory controller 802 at first temporarily stores the digitized pickup image signal in the buffer memory 12 and then reads out the stored digital signal in order as determined by the arrangement of color filters of the image sensor 6. The digital signal thus read out is converted into a signal of a predetermined format by the digital signal processing circuit 8",1010,11,03. The signal thus processed is recorded on the memory

This potential is expanded into Legendre polynomials according to $V(r,R)=\sum^{\infty}_{l=0}{V_l(r,R) P_l(\cos{\theta})}$ [@greiner] separating the equations into multipolar coupled equations. The mapped Fourier grid method is used to build a matrix representation of Eqs. \[syseqnG\] and \[syseqnG2\]. Upon diagonalization of the matrix representation a complete basis is obtained spanning both the positive and negative continua [@me1].

Propagating the initial states is accomplished by the application of the propagator to each initial state. The full propagator is given by, $$\label{expH}
| \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\rangle=\hat{{\rm T}}\left\{ \exp\left(-i \int_{t_0}^t dt' H(t')\right) \right\}| \Psi(\mathbf{r},t_0) \rangle,$$ where $| \Psi(\mathbf{r},t_0) \rangle$ is the initial state, $\hat{{\rm T}}$ is the time-ordering symbol, and $H(t')$ is the time-dependent Dirac hamiltonian for the collision. Since the direct application of this propagator is not efficient for our purposes we use a short-time-step approximation: $H(t)$ is approximated to change linearly to $H(t+\Delta t)$.

In order to propagate the initial state forward a time-step $\Delta t$, it is expanded into an eigenbasis of $H(t+\Delta t)$, with eigenvalues $E_m(t+\Delta t)$. The propagator applied to the $m$th state thus yields, $$\label{proptrap}
\hat{{\rm T}}\left\{ \exp\left(-i \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t} dt' H(t')\right) \right\} \approx  
\exp\left(-i \frac{E_m(t+\Delta t)-E_m(",769,11,t)}{2}\Delta t \right).$$

In an online services context, strong perceptions towards online ads provide fertile ground for shoppers to become increasingly price-sensitive (Osakwe and Chovancová [@CR31]). This may be particularly true with regard to the use of price comparison websites. This study, therefore, extends this line of the suggestion by including eSwitching behaviour as an alternative outcome of online ads' perceived usefulness. Consequently, the following hypotheses were developed:*H6: Customers' perceived usefulness of ads positively influences their perception of price comparison websites.H7: Customers' perceived usefulness of ads positively influences their eSwitching behavior.*

The above literature review and proposed hypotheses can be summarized in the theoretical model proposed in Fig. [1](#Fig1){ref-type=""fig""}. This model extends prior research (e.g. Osakwe and Chovancová [@CR31]) by our assessment of enablers to the perceived use of price comparison websites and eSwitching behavior, especially concerning young and existing online shoppers.Fig. 1.Empirical model

This invention is advantageous inasmuch as that an easily implemented method is provided, by which autologous therapeutically-effective proteins, capable of preparation by induction, in particular immunoglobulin induction, can be prepared and in the form prepared this way, i.e. together with the other components of the body fluids in the syringe, can be administered directly to the patient, i.e. without further manipulation such as transfer to another container, for example. If necessary, centrifuging and/or sterile filtration can be provided for separating solid components. The use of commercially available and often expensive drugs is therefore unnecessary. Furthermore, the use of therapeutically-effective autologous proteins is possible which until now have not been legally authorized drugs and therefore not legally available. Finally the invention, which is based on the drug preparation taking place outside the patient, proves to be advantageous in that contamination, impurities, infection or similar of the therapeutically-effective proteins, are avoided.
In a particularly preferred form of implementing this invention, the therapeutically-effective protein is interleukin 4, interleukin 10 or soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor Type I or Type II, especially preferred being interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (or IL-Ira).
In another especially preferred form of implementing this invention, immunoglobulin G is the immunoglobulin with which the inner structure of the syringe is coated. In the context of this invention, immunoglobulin G is understood to mean isolated immunoglobulin G but also immuno-complexes containing immunoglobulin G, preparations containing immunoglobulin G such as sera, plasma or immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, or preparations or complexes containing the latter.
This invention therefore provides, in a particularly preferred form of implementation, for a method of preparing interleukin 1 receptor antagonists, whereby the inner structure of a syringe is coated with an inductor, in particular an immunoglobulin, and especially preferred immunoglobulin G, the syringe is filled with a body fluid, preferably blood, is incubated and the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist is formed and accumulated in the body fluid. Through the binding or adhesion of the inductor, in particular immunoglobulin G, on the surface of the inner structure of the syringe, the latter is in a position to stimulate the monocytes in the blood to form interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, so that this is accumulated in the blood. After incubation, i.e. after accumulation of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, the blood in the syringe can be supplied without further manipulation, such as transferring into another container for example, directly to the patient from whom the blood put into the syringe had been taken. For separation of solid components, such as cells, centrifuging and/or sterilization can be advantageously provided. The invention therefore also provides that the blood can be taken from the patient by means of the inductor-coated, in particular immunoglobulin G-coated, syringe, the blood can be incubated in the syringe and, after IL-ira information,",692,11, can be supplied to the patient again with the syringe
946,0,25440,0,"Making Database Administration Easier with Freeware

September 12, 2007

Depending on your
environment, working with and between Windows and UNIX can be somewhat
problematic. It seems that no two workplaces are the same when it comes to the
network file system. Two of the more commonly seen problems include not being
able to get a GUI tool (e.g., Oracle Universal Installer) to display and not
being able to have it display at the correct location. There is a freeware tool
to help you work around these problems and make your job of administering
Oracle (and Oracle products) easier.

Common UNIX Environments

Listed below is a list of
environments commonly seen in the workplace. UNIX, in these examples, refers to
Solaris, AIX, HP, Linux and so on (the variants are sometimes referred to as
*NIX).

Case 1 - Physical access
to the UNIX (or database) server

If a smaller server, such as
a SPARC workstation, youre probably in a development shop, so logging onto the
actual server may be as simple as rolling your chair across the office to sign
on. If a larger server, such as those found in a production environment, the
server (or servers) may be located in a computer room. The room may be an
environmentally controlled/temperature regulated/restricted access room, but
the point is, you can go into the room and physically access the server (even
if that means youre pulling out a laptop built in to the rack).

Case 2 - Indirect access to
a specific server

In this environment, your
access or logon to the server is through an application (on your PC) such as
PuTTY. Information about PuTTY can be found in numerous places, and this site is fairly concise and
relevant to our needs.

The information typed into
the Host Name field is the name of the specific server you want to connect
to. You can save the connection information for each server and load them as
needed.

Case 3 - Indirect access
to a specific server via a gateway

What differentiates this
case from the previous one is that you cannot logon directly to a real
server, but first must go through a gateway server (you logon to services,
and once you are authenticated, you can SSH onto your server of interest).

Direct logons are the
easiest when it comes to having a GUI-based application displayed at the
monitor in front of you. It shouldnt be hard to figure out that our number one
GUI-based application of interest here is Oracle Universal Installer.

In general, obtaining or
acquiring command line interface is not a problem. What is a problem, as
evidenced by the roughly 28 million Google hits on Cant open display (and
not counting the seven on MetaLink) is getting a GUI to 1) display and 2)
display to the correct monitor.

X, or The Truth is Out There

If youve ever been frustrated
with X (or X11 or X-Windows), youll definitely enjoy reading chapter 7 of The
UNIX-Haters Handbook. One OpenSSH application in particular can take care
of connecting (via SSH) and displaying GUIs such as OUI, and that application
is Cygwin, a Linux-like environment for
Windows. During the installation of Cygwin, the selection of SSH and X options
give you a quick, easy way to access a server, open an xterm window, and have
GUIs display just like that. After downloading the setup.exe program, the first
several windows shown in the installation process are self-explanatory. The
window you need to go beyond just clicking Next is shown below.

Scroll down to Shells and
select tcsh (expand it and ensure the box is checked). The bash option will
probably work as well, but it may take a few install attempts to get the right
combination for your environment.

Lastly, the other option to
have installed (aside from the defaults) is found by expanding the last
category (X11) and scrolling down to the very bottom. The package of interest
is xterm. Ensure that is selected and click Next to finish the installation
process.

The installation will take a
few minutes (mileage varies based on which mirror site you selected and your
Internet connection). When the installation is finished, start Cygwin and
youll see a shell-like window. This window will look and operate",1019,11," much like
youre on a Linux machine"
947,0,27568,0,"FIFA 12: First Game Details Revealed

Interesting news now for those of you that are looking forward to the arrival of the FIFA 12 game later this year, as we’ve just received word that the very first game details have recently been revealed, courtesy of the French version of the Official PlayStation Magazine.

As Andy Robinson over at computerandvideogames.com recently reported, the upcoming FIFA 12 game – which has been confirmed for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows – will include the ‘Impact Engine,’ which realistically tracks contact between players.

The FIFA 12 game will also introduce AI Vision Game (a rough translation), which promises to deliver more realistic passing. The AI is also said to be more human in the upcoming FIFA game, with all players acting more or less according to their abilities.

According to OPM France, the FIFA 12 will also come with three new arenas, which will feature impressive lighting effects and integrated benches along the sidelines. The AI will also be able to keep track of areas of the body that players injure during matches.

The game will also feature a brand new menu interface, which appears to be more ergonomic and simpler than before. As Sehran at gamepur.com recently noted, footballer Wayne Rooney commented on Twitter recently, claiming FIFA 12 to be the best FIFA game yet.

I hope the AI really does improve because I play clubs a lot of the time and when you rely on the computer AI to defend, they often pause and miss the ball and do really glitchy stuff that's uncharacteristic of a real player. It's quite annoying so I hope they have really made an impact on AI and not just said it.

BinLaden

They should program the AI so it mimics the human. That would make it better

Free kicks are fine, maybe even too easy, but that doesn't bother me. It's cool to blast in a free kick from 40 yards. I'd like to see a custom team maker, without having to do manager mode or ultimate team. The creation centre only allows you to make custom teams with custom players, but I'd like to make a team with real players. They also really need to figure out the quitting issue online.

1.) TURN THE AUTOSAVE OFF IN CAREER MODE. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.
2.) Ghana, Japan, Serbia, Ivory Coast
3.) ARGENTINE LEAGUE PLEASE!
3.) Player growth in career mode is a disaster. (e.g. Wilshere plays and starts all of my games but after 3 years his rating is still the same)
4.) I'd love it if legendary teams were made available (e.g. The Arsenal Invincibles)
5.) More realistic substitutions. (e.g. Drogba gets subbed out after scoring a brace)
6.) The game is too congested in midfield.
7.) IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET BY DEFENDERS. After you successfully get by them, they suddenly get a turbo boost and chase you down easily.
8.) Too reliant on the analog stick for juking; I wish regular button movements could be enough to get by defenders to make the game more enjoyable.
9.) Handball calls are plentiful when handball is turned on. Really irritating.
10.) BIG BIG PROBLEM IN EDIT PLAYER: I want to make a player into a CM but it's impossible. The only midfield positions are CAM and CDM. What the? Also, I tried making a player into an RW, the only forward positions are RF, LF, and ST. FIX THIS FAST. It's ruining the realism for me.
11.) Wilshere looks like Jay Spearing. Seriously, it's appalling. Better player models please.
12.) The commentary hasn't changed in 3 years. Please make it more exciting.
13. Revamp the free kick system. It's frustrating at times.

bern

Ghana, Japan, and Ivory Coast should added in fifa 12.
In career mode individuals should be able to indicate the cost at which he/she wishes to sell a player.
Career mode rivalry teams should be enhanced.
Most of the computer AI for the 2nd and 3rd division teams are almost the same.
To make the career more interesting is to enable users change or enhance the football jerseys of their career teams after promotion from 1 division to the next or winning many accolades.

Should Twins Sleep in the Same Room? It’s been a year coming, and quite honestly it’s probably been the roughest battle for me as a Mom of Twins. The transition from crib to bed! No, they’ve never fallen out. Not scared of the dark.

It’s the fact that bedtime was always one huge slumber party! Last year, as soon as the twins went from crib to bed, it’s been a fit of giggles, jumps and chaos! The hyper madness was too much to take, they would go at it for hours. Then, after such a late bedtime, they would be so grouchy and tired the next day {no longer having naps either}. It was especially frustrating since my daughter started grade school last year, and was up half the night listening to her twin toddler sisters partying in the next room. We were all so tired!

So, I adjusted the best way I could – one of them {always Katie} started sleeping in the hallway. I would put Sophia to bed and Katie would get her pillow and a blanket and lay down in the hallway. After she fell asleep, I would carry her back to her bed and there they would both sleep until morning.

Yep, my toddler slept in the hallway for a year. sigh.

About once a week I would try and get them both to fall asleep in their beds, only to have the slumber party fill the evening. Reminders, Shhh’ing, pleading and yes threatening {to take a toy away} – would not help. Each time I tried, I gave up after an hour, and end up seperating the twins and putting Katie in the hallway {then, and only then would they fall asleep within 5 minutes}.

Yep, in the",389,11, hallway. Katies spot. I’ll never

Earth's aurorae, or northern and southern lights, provide a dazzling light show to people living in the polar regions. Shimmering curtains of green and red undulate across the sky like a living thing. New research shows that aurorae on distant ""hot Jupiters"" could be 100 to 1,000 times brighter than earthly aurorae. They also would ripple from equator to poles, due to the planet's proximity to any stellar eruptions, treating the entire planet to an otherworldly spectacle.

""I'd love to get a reservation on a tour to see these aurorae!"" said Ofer Cohen from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Earth's aurorae are created when energetic particles from the Sun slam into our planet's magnetic field. The field guides solar particles toward the poles, where they smash into Earth's atmosphere, causing air molecules to glow like a neon sign. The same process can occur on planets orbiting distant stars, known as exoplanets.

Particularly strong aurorae result when Earth is hit by a coronal mass ejection (CME) — a gigantic blast that sends billions of tons of solar plasma (electrically charged hot gas) into the solar system. A CME can disrupt Earth's magnetosphere — the bubble of space protected by Earth's magnetic field — causing a geomagnetic storm. In 1989, a CME hit Earth with such force that the resulting geomagnetic storm blacked out huge regions of Quebec, Canada.

Cohen and his colleagues used computer models to study what would happen if a gas giant in a close orbit, just a few million miles from its star, were hit by a stellar eruption. He wanted to learn the effect on the exoplanet's atmosphere and surrounding magnetosphere.

The alien gas giant would be subjected to extreme forces. In our solar system, a CME spreads out as it travels through space, so it's more diffuse once it reaches us. A hot Jupiter would feel a stronger and more focused blast, like the difference between being 100 miles (160 kilometers) from an erupting volcano or 1 mile (1.6 km) away.

""The impact to the exoplanet would be completely different than what we see in our solar system and much more violent,"" said Vinay Kashyap from CfA.

In the model, a CME hits the hot Jupiter and weakens its magnetic shield, and then CME particles reach the gas giant's atmosphere. Its aurora lights up in a ring around the equator 100 to 1,000 times more energetic than earthly aurorae. Over the course of about 6 hours, the aurora then ripples up and down toward the planet's north and south poles before gradually fading away.

Despite the extreme forces involved, the exoplanet's magnetic field shields its atmosphere from erosion.

""Our calculations show how well the planet's protective mechanism works,"" said Cohen. ""Even a planet with a magnetic field much weaker than Jupiter's would stay relatively safe.""

This work has important implications for the habitability of rocky worlds orbiting distant stars. Because red dwarf stars are the most common stars in our galaxy, astronomers have suggested focusing on them in the search for earthlike worlds.

However, since a red dwarf is cooler than our Sun, a rocky planet would have to orbit very close to the star to be warm enough for liquid water. There, it would be subjected to the sort of violent stellar eruptions Cohen and his colleagues studied. Their future work will examine whether rocky worlds could shield themselves from such eruptions.

Earth's aurorae, or northern and southern lights, provide a dazzling light show to people living in the polar regions.

954,0,27230,0,"Sunday morning, a group of fed-up service workers descended on the house of Kevin Rose, professional asshole. They unfurled two banners, one read “Kevin Rose Parasite,” given that he makes an obscene amount of money to fund people to create nothing, leeching off our actual work, and another banner read “Ima Snip Snip yr Ballz,” a reference to Kevin’s televised “joke” about cutting off women’s breasts with scissors. About ten minutes into the demonstration, Kevin arrived with a couple of his bros, and the group got a chance to confront exemplars of the latest round of tech misogyny. A video will follow shortly.

Kevin Rose: Leech

We are here to tell you about Kevin Rose, an employee of Google. At a glance, he might appear to be any other hipster techie walking down the street, but there is something deeper and far more sinister at play below his well-manicured hair. But first, we have to give you some background.

Behind every gentrifying hipster techie there is a tech company. In the beginning, each of the tech giants was nothing more than a startup, and behind every startup there is always a venture capitalist. Ram Shriram once invested in a startup called Google, the love-child of Sergey Brin and Larry Page, two Stanford students with a search algorithm for the internet. This venture capitalist gambled on the Google startup in 1999 and now he is on the board of a company currently worth around 400 billion dollars. Without venture capitalists like Shriram, there would never have been a Google.

As a way of honoring the system that brought them their wealth, Brin and Page created Google Ventures, the venture capital wing of the corporation. The employees of Google Ventures select startups and existing companies to either fund or acquire. Many of these investments are located in the Bay Area and the employees of these newly funded or acquired startups have moved to San Francisco and parts of Oakland.

It has now come to the point where even Diet Coke advertisements are referencing the influx of techies and their startups. With venture capital in their pockets, these wealthy professionals with few attachments are able to pay hyper inflated rents and property prices, displacing long time residents and increasing the cost of living. Tech-workers on average earn four times the wages of a normal service worker.

Venture capitalists enable these tech-workers by funding their startups. With the success of each startup, more and more ambitious tech-workers flock to the city and displace underemployed service workers to the cities at the far reaches of the BART line. These workers must then commute back to San Francisco or Oakland every morning, in most cases to perform menial tasks for the entitled scum who drove them out in the first place.

Which brings us back to Kevin Rose, founder of Digg.com and current venture partner at Google Ventures. He has already helped Google acquire Nextdoor.com and invested his own money in Foursquare, hoping to cash out when a giant buys it. We are here today because a few of the thousands low-paid, underemployed service workers got fed up with Kevin Rose treating them like the shit one scrapes from their boot, not even worthy of eye contact or the basic pleasantries generally taken for granted in our culture.

Recognizing that Kevin Rose is not just another techie asshole, but rather a meta-leech funding and profiting off the gentrification of San Francisco, we chose to bring the class war to his doorstep on our own terms. Rather than be subservient and do his bidding in exchange for the currency we need to commute home and back, we are here today in uncompromising solidarity with every person forced out of the city by the insane hyper-gentrification created through the",803,11," tireless efforts of people like Kevin Rose.

956,0,27728,0,"Onset of Indian winters has been synonymous with the arrival of migratory birds for ages. But over the last few decades, several of these winged visitors have displayed a change in seasonal movements due to the destruction of - or threat to - their habitats. The sighting of six black-necked cranes in a remote Tawang village has swept local activists, conservationists and environmentalists with a wave of cheer.

The black-necked crane is an endangered bird that has chosen a remote – untouched from modern ills – area deep inside Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh as its wintering site. Zemithang on the Nyamjang Chhu river in the Pangchen Valley of Tawang district is its chosen winter abode, now threatened due to a proposed hydropower project. Zemithang is one of the only two wintering sites of the black-necked crane in India, the other being Sangti Valley in neighbouring West Kameng district.

Black-necked cranes migrate from Tibet during the winter. Classified as ""vulnerable"" in the list of endangered species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), these beauties also figure in schedule I list under our Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

According to data on migratory birds by ENVIS Centre on Avian Ecology, hosted by Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), almost 20 per cent of all known bird species, about 2000 of them, make regular seasonal movements.

Alarmingly, “more than 40 per cent of these migratory species are declining and nearly 200 are now classified as globally threatened.” The dangers they face include destruction and degradation of habitats, pollution and badly-s",401,11,"ited infrastructure.

957,0,28639,0,"Tiltrotor

A tiltrotor is an aircraft which generates lift and propulsion by way of one or more powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotatable engine pods or nacelles usually at the ends of a fixed wing or an engine mounted in the fuselage with drive shafts transferring power to rotor assemblies mounted on the wingtips.  Almost all tiltrotors use a bicopter design with two transverse rotors, with the exception of only a few (such as the quadcopter Bell X-22).

Tiltrotor design combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft.  For vertical flight, the rotors are angled so the plane of rotation is horizontal, lifting the way a normal helicopter rotor does.  As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors are progressively tilted forward, with the plane of rotation eventually",190,11, becoming vertical.  In this mode the rotors provide

Before we advance to Week 1 (haven't invited yet, don't worry!), everyone must declare and give brief explanation of their playbook and play style intent. We do not use custom def play books. If you use default playbook, just list it but still explain your intended style. If you create custom, please list your formations and sets and then explain intended style.
Remember... we do not change whole play books mid-season for any reason. If you change jobs, you take your play books with you.

Exceptions:
-we do not mind if you change a few plays or throw a set in or out (not whole new formation) during season but you must write a small write-up (make it fun) of why and what
-you are allowed to petition wholesale playbook change in off-season or when changing school but must give reason and provide fun story/write-up to go with the reason for change

Summary rule: once declared, ANY change to your playbook should be posted and explained. Wholesale changes must be requested and then upon approval... posted and explained.

Guest-Star Party Member: At several points (including the final boss) someone with a gun hangs around behind you to provide extra firepower. They're never as strong as the actual party members, but the extra firepower is free, so who's complaining?

You'd be justified in complaining when Ferwin marries Marie and she tags along for an entire chapter. Many of the enemies in this area have tricky mechanics- Opal Swarms go invisible every time they get hit, and Forest Mimics become immune to a given damage type after taking a certain amount of it. Because your Guest-Star Party Member is not under your control, she will periodically attack at an inopportune time and cause a much more powerful attack to be completely wasted. And Ferwin has the condition 'lovestruck' for the duration, which gives a number of negative status effects.

Human Popsicle: In an interesting variation, most of the population of the world underwent this to wait out a disaster, except a few who stayed awake for maintenance. Sadly, the weapons used to fight the Rakari killed an awful lot of them when the controller was driven insane... twice.

Load-Bearing Boss: The final boss. Though to be fair he was wrecking the place up pretty bad before you even arrived, and just got worse once he started fighting you. It's a wonder the ceiling held long enough to finish your fight.

Magic from Technology and/or Magitek: The game turns more sci-fi the closer you get to the end. However, not all the setting's magic has any relation to technology (such as the skills of the party members themselves).

Marathon Boss: The Bonus Boss, Urtat Underval. He's a Stone Wall, and heals himself when low on health. Defeating him is extremely difficult and often takes quite a while.

Also Count Cristoff. His health actually decreases throughout the fight, but every attack he makes drains a sizable portion of his target's health, so if you damage him, he can just drain it back. It gets even worse once he gets low on health and uses an attack that makes him disappear for a long time and regenerate about 2000 Hit Points. Needless to say, the battle can drag on for quite a while.

Although effective use of the brace skill allows you to reduce the damage of his attacks, and coincidentally the strength of his healing, to such pathetic levels that his fight becomes an extremely short cakewalk.

The king, though, is Ick Thelloth. He doesn't have any way of healing himself except for some token extremely slow regeneration, but he reflects a percentage of all damage he receives back onto one of your party members, in a form that ignores armor and cannot be dodged or resisted. So if you try to kill him too fast you die, and just hitting him at all usually requires waiting for him to randomly select the party member you can most easily heal for his ability, launching one or two solid attacks, and healing up, by which time your window of opportunity to attack has likely closed. And he has a lot of health, and some devastating active attacks.

Mind Rape: The Rakari used this as a weapon during their war against humanity, and may or may not still do so when necessary for security (though the end of Enshadu's story implies that their mind control is refined enough that they probably don't have to). This is also Ick Thelloth's modus operandi.

Mirror Match: The Imagination battle if you have a party of Ionae, Pyan Pau, and Denever. (Doubly so for Ionae and Enshadu, who actually fight themselves)

March 17, 2011

Today, our relief items arrived with two trucks with diapers, blankets, water and wet wipes. We are expecting three more trucks to arrive tomorrow. I was deeply encouraged that 30 volunteers, who are students and teachers from the local junior high here, helped to unload the items into a warehouse in Tome and then, later onto our vehicle as well as the local authority's vehicles.

We will start distribution tomorrow in Minami Sanriku, where 9,600 people have been displaced in 40 shelters. It is one of the towns hit most severely by the tsunami. Authorities have a well-organized way of distribution, listing the needs of the people and a schedule for NGOs. Ours is slotted for tomorrow. Dave Toycen, president of World Vision Canada, will be joining us alongside World Vision Japan's National Director.

The highlight for me today was when I sat down and spoke with the Mr. Sato, town mayor of Minami Sanriku, and Mr. Endo, the vice town mayor. It was hard for me to even watch them tell their stories as I could see tears formed in their eyes and the very sight of that broke my heart.

966,0,25457,0,"Many electronic systems utilize high voltage signals that exceed the 5V or less logic signal levels of typical digital systems. For example, applications such as communications systems that incorporate modems, serial line drivers, etc., may be required to operate at elevated voltage levels. In many flat panel displays, row and column electrodes are driven by low cost integrated circuits (`ICs`) that must be capable of driving high voltages. Many types of nonvolatile semiconductor memories, e.g. EPROMs, EEPROMs and flash EEPROMs, require on-chip manipulation of high voltage signals in order to control programming. Implantable electronic medical devices, such as pacemakers, often require signal or output voltages in the range of 5V to 40V.
Conventional monolithic high voltage amplifier circuits have been fabricated in special Complimentary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (""CMOS"") processes that permit high voltage operation, since transistors fabricated in conventional low voltage CMOS processes typically break down at voltages around 6V to 10V. Transistor breakdown is due to phenomenon such as zener breakdown of the drain, short channel effects and gate oxide failure. J. Y.

967,0,22696,0,"The present invention relates to internal combustion engines, and, more particularly, to exhaust gas recirculation systems used with internal combustion engines.
An exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system is used for controlling the generation of undesirable pollutant gases and particulate matter in the operation of internal combustion engines. Such systems have proven particularly useful in internal combustion engines used in motor vehicles such as passenger cars, light duty trucks, and other on-road motor equipment. EGR systems primarily recirculate the exhaust gas by-products into the intake air supply of the internal combustion engine. The exhaust gas which is reintroduced to the engine cylinder reduces the concentration of oxygen therein, which in turn lowers the maximum combustion temperature within the cylinder and slows the chemical reaction of the combustion process, decreasing the formation of nitrous oxides (NoX). Furthermore, the exhaust gases typically contain unburned hydrocarbons which are burned on reintroduction it the engine cylinder, which further reduces the emission of exhaust gas by-products which would be emitted as undesirable pollutants from the internal combustion engine.
When utilizing EGR in turbocharged diesel engine, the exhaust gas to be recirculated is preferably removed upstream of the exhaust gas driven turbine associated with the turbocharger. In many EGR applications, the exhaust gas is diverted directly from the exhaust manifold. Likewise, the recirculated exhaust gas is preferably reintroduced to the intake air stream downstream of the compressor and air-to-air aftercooler (ATAAC). Reintroducing the exhaust gas downstream of the compressor and ATAAC is preferred due to the reliability and maintainability concerns that arise if the exhaust gas passes through the compressor and ATAAC. An example of such an EGR system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,802,846 (Bailey), which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.
A turbocharger as described above typically includes a turbine having a fixed geometry inlet which receives exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold for driving the turbine wheel in the turbine. Since the inlet has a fixed geometry, the rotational speed of the turbine wheel, and in turn the rotational speed of the compressor wheel, is principally dependent upon the flow characteristics of the exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold. The pressure ratio of the compressed combustion air outputted from the compressor thus may not be varied to any significant extent. This in turn may limit the effectiveness of mixing the compressed combustion air with the exhaust gas.
With conventional EGR systems as described above, the charged and cooled combustion air which is transported from the ATAAC is at a relatively high pressure as a result of th charging from the turbocharger. Since the exhaust gas is also typically inducted into the combustion air flow downstream of the ATAAC, conventional EGR systems are configured to allow the lower pressure exhaust gas to mix with the higher pressure combustion air. Such EGR systems may include a venturi section which induces the flow of exhaust gas into the flow of combustion air passing therethrough. An efficient venturi section is designed to xe2x80x9cpumpxe2x80x9d exhaust gas from a lower pressure exhaust manifold to a higher pressure intake manifold. However, because varying EGR rates are required throughout the engine speed and load range, a variable orifice",677,11, venturi may be preferred. Such a variable orifice
968,0,22726,0,"1. Field of the Description
The present description relates, in general, to displays such as those used to provide digital signage, and, more particularly, to systems and methods for enhancing backlighting levels (or illumination levels) and/or content provided (e.g., display content or displayed content) with digital signs (or signage) including, but not limited to, digital signage in which a display device or source of the content is camouflaged or disguised to limit or eliminate detection by a viewer (e.g., a translucent texture layer, a thematic overlay, a monitor-camouflaging sheet, or the like may be positioned over a monitor or display screen to hide its presence to viewers).
2. Relevant Background
In many settings, information and images are continuously being presented to viewers or people passing by a location. For example, shopping malls and airport terminals are filled with displays providing information and advertisements. Many of these displays are built up around conventional television monitors and displays such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and plasma display devices. These displays have become a standard tool for advertisement, reprogrammable signage, information stations, and menu boards (which together may be called “digital signage”).
One of the reasons these display devices have become ubiquitous is the ease of changing content and/or messaging on the display quickly and effortlessly, which may equate to reduced costs, efficiencies in providing new and changing content, and up-to-date information. Further, the costs of LCDs and other display devices have continued to decrease over time while the size of such displays can range from very small screens to many square feet so that these devices are desirable and useful in many business models.
However, in many settings, the use of conventional displays such as an LCD is undesirable. For example, theme parks and other settings such as restaurants often would prefer not to use an LCD or similar device due to the conventional television (TV)-based aesthetics. These settings may have taken considerable effort to provide a thematic decorative scene and simply placing an LCD or similar display in these spaces would spoil the desired effect. For example, a television simply looks out of place in a colonial village or in a wizard's store front. Similarly, it would not be theme-appropriate to use an LCD as a menu board in a “wild west” restaurant or in a renaissance fair booth.
To address these problems, digital signage systems have been developed that provide a thematic or camouflaging overlay over a digital display such as an LCD to provide eye-catching digital signage. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,013,515, issued on Apr. 21, 2015 and incorporated herein in its entirety, teaches a system that combines an emissive or transmissive display with a thematic overlay to hide or disguise the presence of the display by setting the display's illumination levels to blend its output with diffuse reflection of environmental light off the thematic overlay.
In this way, the output of the display (e.g., an LCD or other display device) can appear to be writing, artwork, or the like on or in the surface of the thematic overlay, and this overlay may appear to be a chalkboard, a piece of wallpaper, a wood, stone, or other material wall, and so on to fit into a particular display environment to appear “natural” to observers or viewers of this digital signage. The effect provided by such digital signage systems has been received with a great deal of excitement by developers and users of digital signage as it transforms mundane digital signage into a display that is surprising and eye catching.
With increased use of digital signage such as emissive and/or transmissive displays blended with diffuse reflection, a number of problems with their installation and extended use have been identified that may reduce the effectiveness of these display systems or at least reduce the eye-catching ability of such digital signage. For example, one difficulty with deploying such digital signage has been that setup and maintenance can require relatively careful light balancing, e.g., balancing the illumination level of the display device and light in the environment. The effect involves projecting content from a display through a semi-opaque overlay such that front lighting reflects off the overlay material so as to hide the presence of the display when it is off but to allow the display to overpower or",882,11, match the front lighting when it is turned on or illuminated

We started giving out electronic copies of What's up with Catalonia? to tourists at Gaudí's spectacular Sagrada Família tourist magnet on Thursday. It's harder than it sounds.

First, you have to get up the nerve to speak to total strangers when the only thing they've heard about people from Barcelona is that we're all pickpockets. We started at the line of people waiting to go in. ""Hi, do you speak English?"" I tried. Yes, said an older couple. ""I've edited a book of essays about Catalan politics,"" I said, as I showed them the ""What's up Card"". ""No, we're not interested."" Oh dear.

My second try was similarly unsuccessful. ""Catalan politics"" was definitely not the right way to go about it.

My third try was with three women with dredlocks and noserings. I noted an Irish accent. ""Hey, do you speak English?"" I ventured. They nodded. ""We're giving away a book about the Catalan independence process,"" and I handed her a card. ""Oh, you mean like Scotland?"" Now, I was getting somewhere.

From there it got steadily easier, and more fun. I got braver, and instead of trying to guess nationalities, I talked to everyone. I explained that we were offering a free copy of the book, pointed up at the Catalan independence flags hanging from balconies on the street, and explained that Catalans just want their voices heard.

""I'm curious,"" a Dutch woman told me, taking the card. ""Thanks."" ""You used to be part of Spain too,"" I told her. Her friend laughed.

An older Danish woman warned against violence. I promised her that Catalans are determined to win back their country peacefully, by voting.

Another couple lost no time, telling me pointedly, ""We're not interested.""

I saw a German couple talking and pointing at the card for several minutes after I left them.

An Ethiopian man told me he lived in Barcelona but didn't know very much about the process. ""But they should be able to vote, right?"" he told me.

A young couple with English accents said, ""you mean like the Scottish?"", and somehow it didn't sound quite as positive. I asked them where they were from. Birmingham. What do you think about the Scottish referendum?"" I asked. ""They can do whatever they want,"" the man answered with an annoyed expression. I congratulated them on their democracy, and explained that in Spain, Catalans are not allowed to vote on their own future.

When I got home that afternoon, I saw that people had already started to download the book: the first from Cambridge (not sure if it was Massachusetts or England), Seville, Atlanta, GA, Madrid, and Belgium. If you'd like to share Catalonia's story, feel free to come down to the ANC who are helping me distribute the cards (Marina, 315 in Barcelona), print out the cards yourself, or just send the link around. Thanks!

Summer in Barcelona is high-tourist season. Everywhere you look there's someone checking a map, standing in line to see a Gaudí building, nursing a sunburn, or buying an ice cream. While lots of locals are fed up—especially with the drunk ones that sing loudly into the night or run naked through the streets—I look at tourists as potential distributors abroad of information about the Catalan independence process.

Every time I get on a metro or have a coffee in my plaça and overhear another language close by, I wish I had some way of telling them, ""Hey, there's more here than meets the eye. These people want to get their country back. They want to be independent again and decide their own destiny. They want to do it peacefully and they want to vote on November 9th.

Some Issues About Cygwin[Linux in Windows] (socket,thread,other programming and shell issues)

I have some question about cygwin  :

Can I use Cygwin develop socket based code? 
Does Cygwin have read() and write() functions that work with file descriptors?
Can I use Pthread library in Cygwin?
Does code that compiles in Cygwin also
compile in Linux without any change or with little change?
Will an executable file that built by
Cygwin run in Linux?
Why does Cygwin not need the linker
option -lpthread when I use pthread library?
why in #include <iostream> don't I need to use using namespace std;?
Can I work with QT in Cygwin?  If so,How?
Can I boot my Linux in other
partition with Cygwin and use it?
Can I access the other partition
 that is EXT3 in Cygwin?

A:

On 1: 
Yes.  Socket libraries are shipped with Cygwin - many socket based apps such as web servers are included in the base distribution.
On 2: 
Yes.  I think all of the'section 2 and 3' system calls in the GNU C runtime and library are implemented by the cygwin runtume.  You can check this in the man pages that come with Cygwin.  A list of system calls and std lib calls implementd by Cygwin can be found here.
On 3: Yes. Pthread is included in Cygwin.  The list referred to in the link above mentions pthreads as well.
On 4: Anything built against GNU libraries should work with little or no change between Cygwin and Linux (assuming there are no dependencies missing on Cygwin).  Depending on CPU architecture you may have to worry about word alignment, endianness and other architecture-specific porting issues, but if you're targeting Windows and Linux on Intel your code would have few if any porting issues arising from CPU architecture.
On 5: Cygwin will build a program against its own shared libraries by default but GCC can cross-compile to target other platforms.   You could (in theory) set GCC up to cross-compile to any target supported by the compiler.  There are plenty of resources on the web about cross-compiling with GCC, and I don't think the process will be materially different on Cygwin.
Note that Cygwin binaries will not run on Linux - or Vice-versa.  You will still need separate builds for both.
On 6: Not sure - at a guess it's included in the standard runtime, perhaps because it was necessary to wrap the Win32 threading API for some reason.
On 7: Don't know - it's probably the same on g++ on all platforms.  Apparently a compiler bug.  Dan Moulding's Answer covers this in more detail.
On 8: Yes.  IIRC QT is available in the standard builds and it will certainly compile on Cygwin.  As with Linux/Unix, QT on Cygwin uses an X11 backend so you will need to have an X server such as XMing running.  
In order to avoid the dependency on an X server you may want to build QT apps against the Win32 API,.  It is possible to do this with MinGW, which is a set of header files and libraries to build native Win32 apps with GCC.  MinGW can be used from within a Cygwin environment (an example of GCC on Cygwin cross-compiling to a non-Cygwin target) and the installer from cygwin.com gives you the option of installing it.

975,0,22948,0,"The idea for The Ugly Duckling, writes Paul Binding in his newly published Hans Christian Andersen: European Witness, came to Andersen on a walk. Andersen was already famous by then. He was staying as a guest at an estate on the island of Sjælland. Andersen always got himself invited to places like this — grand homes in faraway places belonging to people who would have otherwise ignored someone of Andersen’s class. Being an artist was like a special pass. With it, you could go anywhere and be anything.

Andersen hobnobbed with the upper classes but never felt quite at home with them. It was this unease, Binding suggests, that prompted The Ugly Duckling. Out on a walk, Andersen soon forgot his feelings of inferiority, and “felt instantly revitalized by all the summer beauty around him.” Andersen’s nature was a place of enchantment, free from the social hierarchies and injustices of the city. Of course, Andersen loved the city, too, because he loved culture. And, even though he often felt ridiculed and misunderstood, Andersen loved people — ordinary, forgotten people, in particular, people who weren’t artists or aristocrats, who often had no shoes. Maybe the countryside reminded him of the good and barefoot people. In nature, you could become simple. Thus Andersen began one of his most popular stories: “Der var saa deiligt ude paa Landet.” (“It was so beautiful out in the country.”)

Hans Christian Andersen never saw the countryside until later in his life. He was",338,11," born in the crowded city of Odense, Denmark,"

Jocelyn and Roger both said that STFC is now communicating a lot better, and they are trying hard, but – there still aren’t enough scientists on Council; STFC has structural issues; and there are “some crazinesses they still haven’t thought through”.

Roger was polite but firm on the issue of whether there was a deliberate overinvestment in astronomy in the past

Roger was very concerned about the suggestion that construction might be concentrated into the labs, rather than university groups. Students have to be trained or the instrumentation field will become moribund, he said.

Asked if we have to cut costs to pay for ESO, Roger and Jocelyn said yes, but we already have : we pulled out of AAT; we reduced membership of WHT and cut operating cost of UKIRT; and of course we pulled out of Gemini. Roger said nobody said we’d have to completely close all Northern Hemisphere observatories.

Finally, when asked how much extra resource was needed to keep those Northern observatories open, Roger said 2-3M. Jocelyn said “a banker’s bonus”.

Longitudinal patterns of fish biodiversity revealed by eDNA metabarcoding and TEF {#Sec5}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to eigenvalues associated with the PCA analyses of eDNA (number of reads) and TEF samples from 14 of the 16 successive river sections from Lake Geneva to the sea, the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explained most of the structures for both datasets (59.1% and 51.8% of the total inertia, respectively). Regarding the co-inertia analysis performed using these first two principal components (PC), the co-inertia criterion was highly significant (RV = 0.736, p \< 0.0001), which demonstrates a clear similarity between the fish assemblage structures described by eDNA metabarcoding and TEF in each of the 14 river sections. The first two co-inertia axes accounted for 85.4% of the total inertia. The first and second co-inertia PCs were highly correlated with the first and second PCs of the independent PCAs performed on the eDNA metabarcoding (R = −0.982 and R = −0.951, respectively) and TEF (R = −0.923 and R = −0.872, respectively) datasets. The coordinates of the eDNA and TEF samples on the first and second co-inertia PCs (Fig. [5](#Fig5){ref-type=""fig""}) were highly correlated (R^2^ = 0.859 and R^2^ = 0.763, respectively, P \< 0.001). The slope and intercept of the two regression lines did not differ from zero and one, respectively (Student's t-test, P \> 0.05).Figure 5Relationships between the standardized scores of the eDNA and TEF samples for each of the 14 river sections on the first (**A**) and second (**B**) principle components of the co-inertia analysis. Solid line: regression of TEF samples on standardized scores of the eDNA samples. Dashed line: regression line with an intercept of zero and a slope of one (dashed line).

The first and the second principal components (PC1 and PC2) of the PCAs performed on all the pooled eDNA samples within each of the 20 successive river sections accounted for 37.4 and 15.4%, respectively, of the total inertia of the dataset (Fig. [6](#Fig6){ref-type=""fig""}). Among the 42 species studied, 15 and 16 species had a loading \>3% on PC1 and PC2, respectively. PC1 ordered the sections from upstream to downstream, and PC2 differentiated the first two river sections (A-GE, B-SE, large impoundments), associated with typical lake species (*Coregonus lavaretus*, *tinca*, *Perca fluviatilis*), and the last deltaic river section (T-PA), associated with estuarine species (*C*. *labrosus*, *Liza ramada*, *Mugil cephalus*).

The present invention relates to a tufting machine used for carpet manufacture.
2. Description of the Related Art
Tufting machines are distinguished over other carpet making methods in that loops of yarn which constitute the pile of the carpet are inserted in a backing medium or cloth, which may be fibrous or woven according to the carpet application. The loops are held in place by the retentive pressure of the backing cloth having been expanded locally through the insertion of the yarn. A subsequent operation covers the rear face of the yarn and backing cloth with a retaining adhesive. The adhesive also holds a further layer of backing material, usually hessian.
The yarn is inserted into the backing material by a multiplicity of needles which perform a reciprocating motion. The needles have eyes at the lower extremities through which yarn is both fed and captured. Generally, the needles are connected to one or more transverse bars known as needle bars so that all needles may be reciprocated together into and out of the backing material. In certain specialized tufting machines, the needles are carried by needle holders that may be selectively latched to a reciprocating latch bar so that the needles are capable of individual selection and only those needles selected are subject to the reciprocation, whilst those not selected are not reciprocated. The reciprocating action usually is delivered through a series of pistons or push rods couple by various conventional means to a rotating main-shaft driven by electric motor or similar means. The coupling mechanism is of a crank-shaft type so that the extent of the needle motion is the throw of the crank. Other more complex arrangements are also known which endow features to enable the motion envelope of the needle to be controlled and easily set to any desired range.
The loops of yarn may be of varying heights on the face side of the carpet in order to provide a patterning effect. There are several techniques for causing this effect, such as changing the tension of yarn from low to high from one insertion of a yarn loop to the next (high pile to low pile). Yarn tension may be set by modulating the speed of the yarn feed mechanism controlling the length of yarn delivered for each loop (stitch). A simple form of yarn feed mechanism uses a pair of rollers with a high friction surface between which the yarn is pinched. Variations in the speed of the rollers allows control of the length of yarn delivered for each tuft of carpet pile. There are many more complex mechanisms for exerting control over the yarn delivery. Some of these deliver control over individual strands of yarn, some over subsets of all the strands.
Additional patterning features include the use of cut pile as opposed to pile formed from loops. The cut pile effect is achieved usually during the tufting process by catching the loops formed by the insertion of yarn",580,11, through the backing cloth on a suitably formed hook on

WAUSAU - A chair in Pam VanOoyen’s office sat empty Thursday morning.

The chair would have been filled by Sara Quirt Sann, for a 9:30 a.m. meeting that morning. But as VanOoyen, who works as a judicial coordinator for Marathon County Circuit Court Judge Michael Moran, sat at her desk in the Marathon County courthouse, she realized Quirt Sann would never fill the chair again.

“She always sat in that chair,” VanOoyen said. “Every time she came in. It was like her chair.... We’d sit there and just share pieces of our lives with each other. And then when it was time to do court, we’d do court.”

VanOoyen said Thursday morning, she removed the chair from her office. At some point, she plans to put it back, and to hang a heart above it as a small memorial to the lawyer who became her friend in their years of working together at the courthouse.

Quirt Sann was killed during Wednesday afternoon’s shooting spree in Wausau’s south metro area. She was working as an attorney in the Tlusty, Kennedy & Dirks law offices, where she rented office space, when shots rang out.

Networks won’t save us, nor will assemblages. Sometimes we contrast networks and hierarchies in value-laden terms. “Networks good, hierarchies bad!” But like any ontological truth, networks are just what there is. Sadly networks have their hierarchies. There are only networks, but they too have their inequalities, their forms of oppression. It just turns out that hierarchy, of the Platonic or Aristotlean sort with respect to essences, or with respect to the sovereign sort with respect to medieval governance (God-King-Father) turns out to be false. That doesn’t mean that power somehow disappears.

In a network, power is called a “hub”. A hub is a point through which a variety of other points in a network must pass to act. Think of airports. You live in a rural region. If you live in a rural region you must travel to this city and then fly to this city in order to get a flight to another city in, say, Europe like London or Paris. That’s a hub. A point of passage. There are hubs all over the places. Sometimes they’re governmental institutions. Sometimes they’re particular resources like oil. Sometimes they’re bosses. At other times they’re airports like LAX or DFW. Sometimes they’re particular figures. Sometimes they’re blogs. Sometimes they’re theoretical movements. So many hubs, so many forms of power. They exercise what I call “gravity”. I think “gravity” is preferable to the term “power” because it intuitively captures how power functions, while deterritorializing it from its humanist reference to social institution. Sure, corporations, governments, signifiers, etc., are all forms of power, can all function as hubs, but so too is the sun a hub.

Hubs produce what I call a “regime of attraction” within a network or assemblage. That is to say, they organize the relations between other nodes in the network. The other nodes are attracted to the hub and are obligated to pass through the node. Their possibilities or “local manifestations” come to be structured by the nodes. If you’re to build anything, for example",488,11,", you have to pass through the node of fossil fuels"

In a recent op-ed piece in theBrussels newspaper De Standaard (23 October) the Dutch (gay and self-declared “humanist”) author Oscar Van den Boogaard refers to Broder’s interview. Van den Boogaard says that to him coping with the islamization ofEurope is like “a process of mourning.” He is overwhelmed by a “feeling of sadness.” “I am not a warrior,” he says, “but who is? I have never learned to fight for my freedom. I was only good at enjoying it.”

As Tom Bethell wrote in this month’s American Spectator: “Just at the most basic level of demography the secular-humanist option is not working.” But there is more to it than the fact that non-religious people tend not to have as many children as religious people, because many of them prefer to “enjoy” freedom rather than renounce it for the sake of children. Secularists, it seems to me, are also less keen on fighting. Since they do not believe in",279,11," an afterlife, this life is the only thing they have"

The Egyptian army unleashed its full anti-aircraft arsenal and hit Alon's plane, but he managed to crash-land unharmed at 20:05, performing a ground loop. Weizmann landed at 20:15. Eddie Cohen, a volunteer pilot from South Africa, crashed and died, although it is unknown whether he was hit by anti-aircraft fire, or a technical problem caused the plane to malfunction. A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the Israeli Air Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first Israeli Air Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.

Even so, the Egyptians were caught by complete surprise and the attack had a profound psychological effect. This was the first time that such aircraft had been used. The Arab armies had previously had complete air superiority and had no knowledge of the existence of fighter aircraft in the Israeli Air Force. An intercepted Egyptian radio message stated: ""We have been heavily attacked by enemy aircraft, we are dispersing"". The official Egyptian report assessed that there were only two airplanes, and that they were Spitfires. According to Ezer Weizmann, the airplanes had not been tested before the attack, and there was no evidence that they could fly or fire their weapons. However, the pilots considered this a minor issue in light of the fact that they were making history by being the first to fly Israeli fighter planes. The combination of the appearance of the IAF, the introduction of Israeli artillery, the Israeli defenses and the threat to his flank convinced al-Mwawi to stop. He concluded that his forces were overstretched and that his positions needed to be consolidated. He left Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib in command of Isdud and ordered him to dig in.

Operations on May 30 – June 1

Between May 29 and June 2, the Israel Defense Forces constantly bombarded the Egyptians in Isdud with Napoleonchik cannons and Givati patrols harassed the Egyptian lines. The 51st Battalion was tasked with laying mines along the main road near Isdud, Yavne and Hill 69. The 3rd Company of the 53rd Battalion, commanded by Yosef Geva, was tasked with harassing the enemy lines, while the 1st Company of the 54th Battalion, commanded by Aryeh Kotzer, was ordered to assault several targets. In his book In the Fields of Philistia, Uri Avnery, who participated in the battles, wrote of the harassment operation that during those days the Egyptians were fearing an Israeli attack and were firing in all directions and launching flares in hopes of discovering their enemy.

Of the preparations, he wrote:

On the night of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company attacked the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, the food that was given to them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' ability to fight.

The present invention relates particularly to a color photographic light-sensitive material for use in making photographic prints.
2. Prior Art and the Problems Thereof
Conventionally color photographic light-sensitive materials for use in making photographic prints are generally formed by coating in order on a reflective support an yellow coupler-containing blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, nonlight-sensitive first interlayer, magenta coupler-containing green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, nonlight-sensitive second interlayer, cyan coupler-containing red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and nonlight-sensitive protective layer.
And particularly in order to prevent the discoloration by ultraviolet rays of the dyes formed by a color development from the respective couplers, an ultraviolet absorbing agent is added to the second interlayer.
However, such conventional print-making color photographic light-sensitive materials have a disadvantage that the dyes formed by a color development from the respective couplers used, particularly the magenta dye and the cyan dye are poor in the resistance to light, tends to be discolored by light with time, and become out of color balance after being discolored.
In that case, if the protective layer also contains an ultraviolet absorbing agent, the resistance to light could be improved.
And by doing so, there is no doubt that the resistance to light of the light-sensitive material can be improved. However, there still exists another disadvantage that the light-sensitive material, after being processed, loses as time goes by the gloss on the surface thereof by light, heat, moisture, and the like; i.e., the so-called sweat phenomenon arises, thus deteriorating the image quality.
The present invention has been made in view of such a situation as described above, and the principal object of the present invention is to provide a color photographic light-sensitive material which is improved so as to prevent possible deterioration of the gloss on the surface thereof caused with time by light, heat, moisture, and the like, and capable of forming a highly light-resistant dye image.
As a result of our various studies on this problem, it has now been found that the above object of the present invention is accomplished by incorporating a 2-(2xe2x80x2-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazole-type compound in the liquid form at normal room temperature into the overcoat layer on the uppermost silver halide emulsion layer of a multilayered color photographic light-sensitive material.
Namely, the present invention is of a color photographic light-sensitive material comprising a reflective support having thereon a plurality of silver halide emulsion layers, of which the emulsion layer located farthest from the support has, on each of both the support side thereof and the opposite side thereof to the support side, at least one nonlight-sensitive layer containing an ultraviolet absorbing agent, said ultraviolet absorbing agent used in said nonlight-sensitive layer on said opposite side of said emulsion layer against said support being a 2-(2xe2x80x2-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazole-type compound which is in the liquid form at normal room temperature.
The embodiment of the present invention will be illustrated in detail below:
The color photographic light-sensitive material of the present invention (hereinafter referred as to the light-sensitive material) has not less than two silver halide emulsion layers, and, in the normal form, has three spectrally different light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers each differently having one of three nondiffusible yellow, magenta and cyan couplers.
The combination of the light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layers with the couplers in a normal instance is such that the cyan coupler is in the red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, the magenta coupler in the green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, and the yellow coupler in the blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer.
There are no special restrictions on the coating order of such respective emulsion layers.
Usually, however, from the reflective support side the yellow coupler-containing emulsion layer, magenta coupler-containing emulsion layer and cyan coupler-containing emulsion layer are coated in the described order. Alternatively, if desired, these layers may also be coated in such an order as of the cyan coupler",919,11,"-containing emulsion layer, magenta coupler-"
